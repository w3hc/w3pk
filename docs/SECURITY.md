# Security Architecture

This document explains the security model of w3pk and how wallet protection works.

## Overview

w3pk provides **multiple layers of security** to protect user wallets:

1. **WebAuthn authentication** - Biometric/PIN gating for wallet access
2. **Application isolation** - Apps cannot access master mnemonic
3. **Origin-specific derivation** - Each website gets unique isolated addresses
4. **Mode-based access control** - STANDARD/STRICT modes are view-only, YOLO mode provides full access
5. **Encrypted storage** - AES-256-GCM encryption at rest
6. **Secure sessions** - In-memory and optional persistent sessions (disabled in STRICT mode)
7. **Persistent session encryption** - WebAuthn-derived key encryption for "Remember Me" functionality

## Enhanced Security Model (v0.8.0+)

### Three Security Modes

w3pk now uses **origin-centric security modes** for wallet derivation:

**STANDARD mode (default):**
- ✅ Address only (no private key)
- ✅ Persistent sessions allowed
- ✅ Best for most applications

**STRICT mode:**
- ✅ Address only (no private key)
- ❌ Persistent sessions NOT allowed
- ✅ Requires biometric/PIN authentication every time
- ✅ Best for high-security applications

**YOLO mode:**
- ✅ Full access (address + private key)
- ✅ Persistent sessions allowed
- ⚠️ Use only when private key access is required

### Application Security Guarantees

**What applications CANNOT access:**
- ❌ Master mnemonic (permanently disabled via `exportMnemonic()`)
- ❌ Private keys in STANDARD mode
- ❌ Private keys in STRICT mode
- ❌ Private keys from other origins
- ❌ Private keys from other modes
- ❌ Direct backup/recovery manager access

**What applications CAN access:**
- ✅ Origin-specific address (all modes)
- ✅ Private keys in YOLO mode only
- ✅ Signatures via `signMessage()` (no key exposure)
- ✅ Encrypted backups via SDK methods

### Mode-Based Security Examples

```typescript
// STANDARD mode (default) - Address only, persistent sessions
const wallet = await w3pk.deriveWallet()
// Returns: { address, index, origin, mode: 'STANDARD', tag: 'MAIN' }
// ✅ Safe for display
// ❌ No privateKey in response
// ✅ Uses cached session (no repeated auth)

// STRICT mode - Address only, NO persistent sessions
const strictWallet = await w3pk.deriveWallet('STRICT')
// Returns: { address, index, origin, mode: 'STRICT', tag: 'MAIN' }
// ✅ Safe for display
// ❌ No privateKey in response
// ⚠️ Requires biometric/PIN authentication EVERY time

// YOLO mode - Full access with private key
const yoloWallet = await w3pk.deriveWallet('YOLO')
// Returns: { address, privateKey, index, origin, mode: 'YOLO', tag: 'MAIN' }
// ✅ Full access for transactions
// ⚠️ Application has access to private key

// YOLO mode with custom tag for specific features
const gamingWallet = await w3pk.deriveWallet('YOLO', 'GAMING')
// Returns: { address, privateKey, index, origin, mode: 'YOLO', tag: 'GAMING' }
// ✅ Different address from MAIN
// ✅ Full access for gaming transactions
```

### Multiple Wallet Management

w3pk supports multiple wallets on a single device, but applications should implement safeguards to prevent accidental wallet creation:

**Detection Methods:**

```typescript
// Check if any wallets exist
const hasWallet = await w3pk.hasExistingCredential()

// Get count of wallets
const count = await w3pk.getExistingCredentialCount()

// List all wallets with metadata
const wallets = await w3pk.listExistingCredentials()
// Returns: [{ username, ethereumAddress, createdAt, lastUsed }, ...]
```

**Security Implications:**

1. **Platform Behavior (iOS/macOS):**
   - Multiple passkeys sync via iCloud Keychain
   - Can cause user confusion if not properly managed
   - Each passkey has its own mnemonic (different wallets)

2. **UX Best Practices:**
   - Always check for existing wallets before registration
   - Show warning if user attempts to create multiple wallets
   - List existing wallets and allow selection during login

3. **Valid Use Cases for Multiple Wallets:**
   - Different personas (personal vs business)
   - Testing and development
   - Family members on shared device
   - Migration scenarios

**Recommended Pattern:**

```typescript
// Before registration
const count = await w3pk.getExistingCredentialCount()
if (count > 0) {
  const wallets = await w3pk.listExistingCredentials()
  // Show warning: "You have {count} wallet(s). Creating a new one will generate
  // a DIFFERENT address. Funds sent to different addresses won't be accessible."
  // Offer: [Login to Existing] [Create New Anyway] [Cancel]
}
```

See [Integration Guidelines](./INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES.md#check-for-existing-wallet-first) for complete implementation patterns.

## Message Signing with Mode Selection

The `signMessage()` method supports **multiple signing methods**, **mode and tag selection**, allowing developers to choose the appropriate signing approach for their use case.

### Signing Methods

w3pk supports four signing methods:

1. **EIP-191 (default)**: Standard Ethereum signed messages
2. **SIWE (EIP-4361)**: Sign-In with Ethereum (Web3 authentication)
3. **EIP-712**: Structured typed data (permits, voting, meta-transactions)
4. **rawHash**: Pre-computed 32-byte hashes (Safe multisig, custom schemes)

### Default Behavior

By default, `signMessage()` uses **STANDARD mode + MAIN tag + EIP-191** (origin-centric):

```typescript
// Default: Sign with STANDARD + MAIN address using EIP-191
const result = await w3pk.signMessage("Hello World")

console.log(result.signature)  // The signature
console.log(result.address)    // Origin-specific STANDARD+MAIN address
console.log(result.mode)       // 'STANDARD'
console.log(result.tag)        // 'MAIN'
console.log(result.origin)     // Current origin
```

### Mode-Based Signing

Choose the appropriate security mode for each signing operation:

```typescript
// STANDARD mode: View-only, persistent sessions
const standard = await w3pk.signMessage("Display balance", {
  mode: 'STANDARD'
})

// STRICT mode: View-only, requires auth every time
const strict = await w3pk.signMessage("Transfer $10000", {
  mode: 'STRICT'
})
// User will be prompted for biometric/PIN authentication

// YOLO mode: Sign from address with private key access
const yolo = await w3pk.signMessage("Gaming transaction", {
  mode: 'YOLO',
  tag: 'GAMING'
})
```

### Multi-Address Signing

Sign from different addresses for different purposes:

```typescript
// Different tags for different features
const mainSig = await w3pk.signMessage("msg", {
  tag: 'MAIN'
})

const gamingSig = await w3pk.signMessage("msg", {
  mode: 'YOLO',
  tag: 'GAMING'
})

const tradingSig = await w3pk.signMessage("msg", {
  mode: 'YOLO',
  tag: 'TRADING'
})

// Each signature comes from a different address!
console.log(mainSig.address !== gamingSig.address)      // true
console.log(gamingSig.address !== tradingSig.address)   // true
```

### Choosing the Right Signing Method

**Security implications of each method:**

| Method | Use Case | Security Level | Verifiable By |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| EIP-191 | General signatures | Standard | `ethers.verifyMessage()` |
| SIWE | Web3 authentication | High | `ethers.verifyMessage()` + message validation |
| EIP-712 | Typed data (permits) | High | `TypedDataEncoder` + domain validation |
| rawHash | Custom schemes | Advanced | `recoverAddress()` + custom validation |

**When to use each method:**

- **EIP-191**: Default choice for simple message signing
- **SIWE**: Authentication flows, login, session management
- **EIP-712**: Token permits, DAO voting, NFT minting, gasless transactions
- **rawHash**: Safe multisig, pre-computed hashes, custom cryptographic schemes

**Security best practices:**

1. **Validate message content**: Always validate what the user is signing
2. **Domain binding**: For EIP-712 and SIWE, ensure domain matches your application
3. **Expiration times**: Use expiration for time-sensitive signatures
4. **Nonce management**: Prevent replay attacks with unique nonces (especially SIWE)
5. **Chain ID validation**: Always include and validate the correct chain ID

### Security Best Practices for Modes

**When to use each mode:**

| Mode | Use Case | Private Key Exposed | Sessions |
|------|----------|---------------------|----------|
| STANDARD | Most applications | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| STRICT | Banking, high-value | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| YOLO | Gaming, low-value | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

**Examples:**

```typescript
// Financial application: Use STRICT mode
async function signTransfer(amount: number, recipient: string) {
  const result = await w3pk.signMessage(
    `Transfer ${amount} to ${recipient}`,
    { mode: 'STRICT' }  // Always requires auth
  )
  return result.signature
}

// Gaming application: Use YOLO mode with custom tag
async function signGameAction(action: string) {
  const result = await w3pk.signMessage(action, {
    mode: 'YOLO',
    tag: 'GAMING'
  })
  return {
    signature: result.signature,
    fromAddress: result.address  // Gaming-specific address
  }
}

// Display/view operations: Use STANDARD mode (default)
async function signProof() {
  const result = await w3pk.signMessage("Prove ownership")
  return result.signature
}
```

### Address Verification

Always verify which address signed a message:

```typescript
const result = await w3pk.signMessage("Important message", {
  mode: 'YOLO',
  tag: 'TRADING'
})

// Verify the signature is from the expected address
const wallet = await w3pk.deriveWallet('YOLO', 'TRADING')
console.assert(
  result.address === wallet.address,
  "Signature must be from trading address"
)

// Use ethers to verify the signature
import { verifyMessage } from 'ethers'
const recovered = verifyMessage("Important message", result.signature)
console.assert(
  recovered.toLowerCase() === result.address.toLowerCase(),
  "Signature verification failed"
)
```

## Traditional Security Guarantees

### ✅ Protected Against

1. **File System Access** - Attacker with access to browser storage cannot decrypt wallet
2. **Malware/Keyloggers** - Encryption key never exists in recoverable form
3. **Memory Dumps** - Keys are ephemeral and derived on-demand
4. **Database Theft** - Encrypted wallet is useless without biometric authentication
5. **JavaScript Injection** - Cannot replay signatures (fresh challenge each time)

### ⚠️ NOT Protected Against

1. **Physical coercion** - Forcing user to authenticate
2. **Compromised authenticator** - If hardware is backdoored
3. **Active browser session** - If wallet is in memory and user is authenticated
4. **Offline mnemonic theft** - If attacker has browser storage files (see Threat Model below)
5. **XSS with active session** - Code injection during authenticated session

## Threat Model

Understanding w3pk's security boundaries is critical for proper deployment. The security model relies on **multiple layers of protection**, not just encryption.

### Security Layers (Strongest to Weakest)

#### 1. WebAuthn Authentication (Strongest Boundary) ✅

**What it protects:**
- Unauthorized access via w3pk SDK
- Remote attacks without physical device access
- Phishing attacks (domain-scoped credentials)
- Cross-site attacks (origin isolation)

**How it works:**
- Browser enforces biometric/PIN authentication
- Cannot be bypassed without physical access + user authentication
- User sees domain in authentication prompt
- Credentials are cryptographically bound to domain

**Limitations:**
- Requires user interaction (can be socially engineered)
- User must verify domain in prompt (many users don't)
- Doesn't protect against session hijacking after authentication

#### 2. Deterministic Encryption (Strong Protection) ⚠️

**What it protects:**
- Casual file system access (encrypted at rest)
- Database theft without credential metadata
- Quick opportunistic attacks

**How it works:**
- Wallet encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Key derived from credential ID + public key (PBKDF2, 210k iterations)
- Requires both localStorage (metadata) AND IndexedDB (encrypted wallet)

**Limitations:**
- **Key is deterministic** - same metadata = same key
- An attacker with BOTH localStorage AND IndexedDB can decrypt offline
- Does NOT require fresh authentication to derive the key
- Protection is authentication-gating by SDK, not cryptographic impossibility

**Honest assessment:**
```typescript
// What an attacker with file access CAN do:
const key = deriveEncryptionKeyFromWebAuthn(stolenCredentialId, stolenPublicKey)
const mnemonic = decryptData(stolenEncryptedWallet, key)
// ✅ SUCCESS - Attacker now has the mnemonic

// What they CANNOT do (without further attacks):
await w3pk.login()  // ❌ Requires WebAuthn authentication
await w3pk.signTransaction(...)  // ❌ Requires WebAuthn authentication

// What they CAN do (outside w3pk):
// Import mnemonic into MetaMask, Ledger Live, etc.
// ✅ Full wallet access if they have the mnemonic
```

**This is why device security is critical:**
- Use device encryption (FileVault, BitLocker)
- Use strong device passwords
- Don't leave device unlocked
- Browser storage is NOT enough protection alone

#### 3. Session Management (Moderate Protection) ⚠️

**What it protects:**
- Time-limited exposure after authentication
- Automatic expiration of cached credentials
- Cleared on browser close

**How it works:**
- Decrypted mnemonic cached in memory only
- Expires after configured duration (default: 1 hour)
- Never written to disk

**Limitations:**
- **Active session = mnemonic in memory**
- Code injection during session can access wallet
- `requireAuth` flag can be bypassed by attacker with JS execution
- Session is in the same JavaScript context as page code

**Attack window:**
```typescript
// Attacker with XSS access during active session:
if (w3pk.hasActiveSession()) {
  const mnemonic = await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: false })
  // ⚠️ SUCCESS - Session allows access, requireAuth is bypassable
  sendToAttacker(mnemonic)
}

// After session expires:
const mnemonic = await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: false })
// ❌ BLOCKED - Session expired, triggers authentication prompt
```

**Mitigation:**
- Use short sessions (`sessionDuration: 0.1` = 6 minutes)
- Or disable sessions entirely (`sessionDuration: 0`)
- Prevent XSS (CSP, input sanitization)

#### 4. `requireAuth` Flag (Weak - UX Only) ❌

**What it protects:**
- User mistakes (accidental clicks)
- Application-level policy enforcement
- User experience (confirmation for sensitive actions)

**How it works:**
- Developer sets `requireAuth: true` for sensitive operations
- SDK triggers fresh authentication prompt

**Limitations:**
- **NOT a security boundary**
- Can be trivially bypassed by code injection:
  ```typescript
  // Attacker bypasses requireAuth
  await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: false })  // ✅ Bypassed
  ```
- Only protects against honest mistakes, not malicious attacks
- Think: seatbelt reminder, not bulletproof vest

**When it helps:**
- Preventing accidental high-value transactions
- Compliance requirements (audit trails showing authentication)
- User education (prompting awareness of sensitive operations)

**When it doesn't help:**
- XSS attacks (attacker controls the JavaScript)
- Malicious browser extensions
- Compromised dependencies
- Any scenario where attacker has code execution

### Threat Scenarios Matrix

| Threat | Layer 1 (WebAuthn) | Layer 2 (Encryption) | Layer 3 (Session) | Layer 4 (requireAuth) | Overall |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **File system access** | ✅ Blocks SDK use | ⚠️ Can decrypt offline | N/A | N/A | ⚠️ Mnemonic exposed |
| **Malware (no session)** | ✅ Blocks SDK | ⚠️ Can decrypt offline | ✅ No cache | N/A | ⚠️ Mnemonic exposed |
| **Malware (active session)** | ✅ Blocks new auth | ⚠️ Can decrypt offline | ❌ Cache accessible | ❌ Bypassable | ❌ Full access |
| **XSS (no session)** | ⚠️ Phishable | ⚠️ Can decrypt offline | ✅ No cache | N/A | ⚠️ Needs auth prompt |
| **XSS (active session)** | ⚠️ Phishable | ⚠️ Can decrypt offline | ❌ Cache accessible | ❌ Bypassable | ❌ Full access |
| **Phishing attack** | ✅ Domain isolation | ✅ Different RP ID | N/A | N/A | ✅ Protected |
| **Database theft only** | ✅ No metadata | ✅ Need metadata | N/A | N/A | ✅ Protected |
| **Credential theft only** | ✅ Need encrypted wallet | ✅ No wallet | N/A | N/A | ✅ Protected |
| **Physical coercion** | ❌ Can force auth | N/A | ❌ Can establish session | ❌ Bypassable | ❌ Vulnerable |
| **Device theft (locked)** | ✅ Need device unlock | ✅ Device encryption helps | N/A | N/A | ✅ Protected |
| **Device theft (unlocked)** | ⚠️ Can auth | ⚠️ Can access files | ⚠️ May have session | ❌ Bypassable | ❌ Vulnerable |
| **Remote network attack** | ✅ Need physical access | ✅ Need physical access | ✅ Not over network | N/A | ✅ Protected |

### Key Takeaways

**What w3pk IS:**
- ✅ Protection against remote attacks without device access
- ✅ Protection against credential theft from other domains (phishing)
- ✅ Protection against accidental leaks (encryption at rest)
- ✅ Protection against keyloggers (no password needed)
- ✅ Better than password-based wallets for online threats

**What w3pk IS NOT:**
- ❌ Protection against offline mnemonic extraction (if attacker has storage files)
- ❌ Protection against code injection with active session (XSS during session)
- ❌ Protection against physical device compromise (need device encryption + strong password)
- ❌ Immune to social engineering (user can be tricked into authenticating)

**Comparison to other approaches:**

| Security Model | w3pk | MetaMask | Hardware Wallet |
|---------------|------|----------|-----------------|
| Remote attack protection | ✅ Strong | ⚠️ Password-dependent | ✅ Strong |
| Local file access | ⚠️ Can decrypt | ⚠️ Can decrypt | ✅ Cannot decrypt |
| Active session compromise | ❌ Vulnerable | ❌ Vulnerable | ⚠️ Per-tx approval |
| Physical theft (locked) | ✅ Protected | ⚠️ Password-dependent | ✅ Protected |
| User experience | ✅ Biometric | ⚠️ Password typing | ⚠️ Hardware required |

**Recommendation:** w3pk is best suited for:
- Applications where user convenience is important
- Scenarios where remote attacks are the primary threat
- Use cases with short sessions or disabled sessions for sensitive operations
- Combined with device encryption and strong device passwords
- Not as a replacement for hardware wallets for high-value holdings (>$10k)

## EIP-7702 Authorization Security

EIP-7702 allows EOAs to delegate code execution to smart contracts through authorization signatures. This is a powerful feature that enables gasless transactions, but requires careful security considerations.

### What is EIP-7702?

EIP-7702 authorizations allow an EOA to **permanently delegate** its code execution to a contract until explicitly revoked. This enables:
- Gasless transactions (sponsor pays gas)
- Smart contract wallet features on regular EOAs
- Account abstraction without deployment

**Critical: Authorizations are PERSISTENT** - they remain active until revoked, not just for a single transaction.

### Security Model

#### Authorization Lifecycle

1. **Sign Authorization (Offline)** - User signs authorization with `signAuthorization()`
2. **First Transaction** - Authorization included in transaction, establishes permanent delegation
3. **All Future Transactions** - Delegation persists, no new authorization needed
4. **Revocation (Manual)** - User must explicitly sign new authorization to revoke

#### Threat Analysis

**✅ Protected Against:**
- Unauthorized signing (requires WebAuthn or active session)
- Phishing (authorization bound to specific contract address + chain ID)
- Replay attacks (nonce-based protection)
- Cross-chain attacks (chain ID binding)

**⚠️ Requires Careful Handling:**
- **Permanent delegation** - User authorizes contract INDEFINITELY
- **Contract security** - If contract is malicious/buggy, user's EOA is compromised
- **No automatic expiration** - Delegation persists until manual revocation
- **Contract upgrades** - If delegated contract is upgradeable, consider upgrade risks

**❌ NOT Protected Against:**
- Malicious contracts (user must verify contract is trustworthy)
- Social engineering (user can be tricked into authorizing bad contracts)
- XSS during active session (can call `signAuthorization()` without auth)

### Security Best Practices

#### 1. Contract Verification (CRITICAL)

**DO:**
- ✅ Only authorize audited, verified contracts
- ✅ Verify contract address matches expected contract
- ✅ Check contract is not upgradeable, or understand upgrade mechanism
- ✅ Understand what the contract can do with your account
- ✅ Test with small amounts first
- ✅ Monitor authorization usage on-chain

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Authorize unknown or unaudited contracts
- ❌ Sign authorizations from untrusted UIs
- ❌ Assume authorization is "temporary" or "one-time"
- ❌ Ignore warnings about permanent delegation

**Example - Safe Authorization:**

```typescript
// GOOD: Verify contract before authorizing
const VERIFIED_GOV_CONTRACT = '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb1'
const AUDIT_REPORT = 'https://audits.example.com/gov-v1.pdf'

// Show user what they're authorizing
console.log(`
⚠️  AUTHORIZATION WARNING
You are about to PERMANENTLY delegate your account to:
Contract: ${VERIFIED_GOV_CONTRACT}
Purpose: Gasless governance voting
Audit: ${AUDIT_REPORT}

This delegation will persist until you explicitly revoke it.
`)

// Only proceed with user confirmation
if (await getUserConfirmation()) {
  const auth = await w3pk.signAuthorization({
    contractAddress: VERIFIED_GOV_CONTRACT,
    chainId: 11155111,
    requireAuth: true  // Force fresh authentication
  })
}
```

#### 2. Session Management

**For sensitive operations, force fresh authentication:**

```typescript
// GOOD: Require fresh biometric authentication
const authorization = await w3pk.signAuthorization({
  contractAddress: govContract,
  chainId: 1
}, {
  requireAuth: true  // User must authenticate
})

// BAD: Uses cached session (vulnerable to XSS)
const authorization = await w3pk.signAuthorization({
  contractAddress: govContract,
  chainId: 1
  // No requireAuth - uses session if available
})
```

**Recommendation:** Always use `requireAuth: true` for EIP-7702 authorizations to ensure user consciously approves the permanent delegation.

#### 3. Monitoring and Revocation

**Check if account is already authorized:**

```typescript
import { publicClient } from 'viem'

// Check if EOA has delegated code
const code = await publicClient.getCode({ address: userAddress })
const isAuthorized = code && code.length > 2

if (isAuthorized) {
  console.log('⚠️  Account already has active delegation')
  // Show user current delegation details
  // Offer to revoke if desired
}
```

**Revoke delegation when no longer needed:**

```typescript
// Revoke by delegating to zero address
const revocation = await w3pk.signAuthorization({
  contractAddress: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  chainId: 11155111,
  nonce: currentNonce + 1n
}, {
  requireAuth: true  // Require authentication to revoke
})

await walletClient.sendTransaction({
  to: userAddress,
  value: 0n,
  authorizationList: [revocation]
})
```

#### 4. Private Key Handling

**For derived and stealth addresses:**

```typescript
// GOOD: Derive key only when needed, clear immediately
const mnemonic = await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: true })
const { privateKey } = deriveWalletFromMnemonic(mnemonic, 5)

const auth = await w3pk.signAuthorization({
  contractAddress: govContract,
  chainId: 1,
  privateKey
})

// Clear sensitive data (JS engine will garbage collect)
privateKey = null
mnemonic = null

// BAD: Store private keys long-term
localStorage.setItem('privateKey', privateKey)  // ❌ NEVER DO THIS
```

#### 5. User Education

**Always inform users about permanent delegation:**

```typescript
// Show clear warning before authorization
const WARNING = `
⚠️  PERMANENT DELEGATION WARNING

You are signing an EIP-7702 authorization that will:
• PERMANENTLY delegate your account to a smart contract
• Allow the contract to execute transactions on your behalf
• Persist until you explicitly revoke it
• Cannot be automatically expired or cancelled

Only proceed if you trust this contract and understand the risks.

Contract: ${contractAddress}
Chain: ${chainId}
`

console.warn(WARNING)
await displayWarningModal(WARNING)
```

### Integration Security

#### Recommended Pattern

```typescript
import { createWeb3Passkey } from 'w3pk'

async function authorizeGovernanceContract() {
  const sdk = createWeb3Passkey({
    sessionDuration: 15,  // Short sessions for security
    onError: (error) => {
      logSecurityEvent('authorization_error', error)
    }
  })

  try {
    // 1. Verify contract (offchain)
    const contractInfo = await fetchContractInfo(GOV_CONTRACT)
    if (!contractInfo.verified || !contractInfo.audited) {
      throw new Error('Contract not verified')
    }

    // 2. Check if already authorized
    const code = await publicClient.getCode({ address: userAddress })
    if (code && code.length > 2) {
      console.log('Already authorized')
      return
    }

    // 3. Show warning to user
    const confirmed = await showAuthorizationWarning(contractInfo)
    if (!confirmed) return

    // 4. Sign with fresh authentication
    const authorization = await sdk.signAuthorization({
      contractAddress: GOV_CONTRACT,
      chainId: CHAIN_ID,
      nonce: 0n
    }, {
      requireAuth: true  // Force biometric/PIN
    })

    // 5. Submit first transaction
    const hash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
      to: GOV_CONTRACT,
      data: firstActionData,
      authorizationList: [authorization]
    })

    // 6. Monitor transaction
    const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash })

    // 7. Log successful authorization
    logSecurityEvent('authorization_success', {
      contract: GOV_CONTRACT,
      chainId: CHAIN_ID,
      txHash: hash
    })

    // 8. Store authorization record for user
    await storeAuthorizationRecord({
      contract: GOV_CONTRACT,
      chainId: CHAIN_ID,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      txHash: hash
    })

  } catch (error) {
    logSecurityEvent('authorization_failed', error)
    throw error
  }
}
```

### Comparison to Other Signing Methods

| Security Aspect | `signMessage()` | `signAuthorization()` |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Scope** | One message | Permanent delegation |
| **Duration** | Single use | Until revoked |
| **Risk level** | Low | High |
| **Requires fresh auth** | Optional | Recommended (always) |
| **Contract verification** | N/A | Critical |
| **Can be phished** | Signature only | Entire account |
| **Revocation needed** | N/A | Yes |

### Key Takeaways

1. **EIP-7702 is NOT temporary** - Delegation persists indefinitely
2. **Always verify contracts** - Malicious contract = compromised account
3. **Use `requireAuth: true`** - Force fresh authentication for authorizations
4. **Monitor authorizations** - Check on-chain code regularly
5. **Educate users** - Make delegation persistence crystal clear
6. **Implement revocation** - Provide easy way to revoke when needed
7. **Log security events** - Track authorizations for security monitoring

## External Wallet Integration Security

w3pk supports EIP-7702 authorization signatures from external wallets (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.) to enable users to delegate their existing accounts to w3pk WebAuthn accounts. This section covers security considerations for this integration.

### What is External Wallet Delegation?

External wallet delegation allows users to:
1. Sign an EIP-7702 authorization with their external wallet (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.)
2. Delegate their external account to their w3pk account
3. Control their external account using w3pk's WebAuthn security

**Benefits:**
- Upgrade existing accounts to WebAuthn security without losing identity
- Keep ENS names, addresses, NFTs, and on-chain history
- Enable gasless transactions for external accounts
- No seed phrase required for daily use

### Security Model

**Trust Assumptions:**
- User must trust the external wallet provider (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.)
- User must trust the w3pk SDK to correctly format authorization messages
- User must verify the delegation address in their external wallet before signing
- Authorization signature is verified using EIP-7702 spec before returning

**Signature Verification:**
```typescript
// All external wallet authorizations are verified before returning
const authorization = await w3pk.requestExternalWalletDelegation({
  chainId: 1,
  nonce: 0n
})

// Verification happens automatically:
// 1. Format EIP-7702 message: 0x05 || rlp([chain_id, address, nonce])
// 2. Request signature from external wallet
// 3. Recover signer address from signature
// 4. Verify recovered address matches expected external wallet address
// 5. Throw error if verification fails
```

### Security Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Verify the delegation address shown in external wallet matches w3pk account
- ✅ Use hardware wallets for high-value account delegations
- ✅ Only delegate to audited w3pk implementations
- ✅ Understand that delegation is permanent until revoked
- ✅ Monitor delegated account activity on-chain
- ✅ Test delegation with small amounts first

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Approve external wallet signatures without reading the delegation address
- ❌ Delegate high-value accounts without understanding the implications
- ❌ Assume external wallet connections are secure without verification
- ❌ Skip user confirmation dialogs in external wallet
- ❌ Trust unverified w3pk implementations with delegation

### Attack Scenarios & Mitigations

#### Scenario 1: Malicious dApp Shows Wrong Delegation Address

**Attack:**
- Malicious dApp displays "Delegate to w3pk: 0xABCD..." in UI
- But actually requests signature for different address: 0x1234... (attacker-controlled)
- User approves without checking external wallet popup

**Impact:** User's external account delegates to attacker's address instead of w3pk

**Mitigation:**
```typescript
// w3pk SDK ALWAYS shows delegation address in external wallet popup
// Users MUST verify address in MetaMask/Rabby matches expected w3pk address

// Good practice: Display w3pk address prominently before requesting signature
const w3pkAddress = await w3pk.getAddress()
console.log(`🔐 You will delegate to: ${w3pkAddress}`)
console.log(`⚠️  VERIFY THIS ADDRESS in MetaMask before approving!`)

const authorization = await w3pk.requestExternalWalletDelegation({
  chainId: 1,
  nonce: 0n
})
```

**Protection Layers:**
1. External wallet shows exact delegation address in popup
2. w3pk SDK verifies signature matches expected signer
3. User must explicitly approve in external wallet
4. Delegation is visible on-chain and can be revoked

#### Scenario 2: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Provider

**Attack:**
- Attacker intercepts `window.ethereum` provider
- Modifies authorization parameters before sending to wallet
- Returns valid-looking but malicious authorization

**Impact:** User unknowingly signs authorization with modified parameters

**Mitigation:**
```typescript
// w3pk SDK uses EIP-7702 utilities for consistent message formatting
// Signature is verified against expected parameters before returning

import { verifyEIP7702Authorization } from 'w3pk'

// Verification happens automatically in SDK
const authorization = await w3pk.requestExternalWalletDelegation({
  chainId: 1,
  nonce: 0n
})

// Additional verification (optional):
const isValid = verifyEIP7702Authorization(
  authorization.chainId,
  w3pkAddress,
  authorization.nonce,
  authorization,
  externalWalletAddress
)

if (!isValid) {
  throw new Error('Authorization signature verification failed!')
}
```

**Protection Layers:**
1. Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents script injection
2. Use HTTPS to prevent network MITM
3. w3pk SDK verifies signature before returning
4. External wallet shows message hash for technical verification

#### Scenario 3: Phishing with Fake External Wallet

**Attack:**
- Attacker creates fake MetaMask/Rabby extension
- Fake wallet approves all signatures without user interaction
- Returns valid signatures for attacker-controlled address

**Impact:** User thinks they're using legitimate wallet but signing malicious authorizations

**Mitigation:**
```typescript
// Detect and verify external wallet before using
import {
  getDefaultProvider,
  detectWalletProvider,
  supportsEIP7702Authorization
} from 'w3pk'

const provider = getDefaultProvider()
if (!provider) {
  throw new Error('No wallet detected')
}

// Show wallet name to user for verification
const walletName = detectWalletProvider(provider)
console.log(`🦊 Detected wallet: ${walletName}`)

if (walletName === 'Unknown Wallet') {
  console.warn('⚠️  Unrecognized wallet - proceed with caution')
}

// Verify wallet supports EIP-1193
const supported = await supportsEIP7702Authorization(provider)
if (!supported) {
  throw new Error('Wallet does not support signing')
}

// Request authorization
const authorization = await w3pk.requestExternalWalletDelegation({
  chainId: 1,
  nonce: 0n
})
```

**Protection Layers:**
1. User must install wallet from official source (browser extension store)
2. w3pk SDK detects wallet type and shows warning for unknown wallets
3. User must manually approve each signature in wallet popup
4. Signatures can be verified on-chain after delegation

### Implementation Checklist

**Before Requesting External Wallet Authorization:**
- [ ] Display w3pk account address prominently
- [ ] Show chain ID and nonce to user
- [ ] Explain what delegation means (permanent until revoked)
- [ ] Verify external wallet provider is legitimate
- [ ] Warn user to verify address in external wallet popup

**After Receiving Authorization:**
- [ ] Verify signature with `verifyEIP7702Authorization()`
- [ ] Display authorization details to user
- [ ] Explain how to include in transaction
- [ ] Provide instructions for revoking delegation
- [ ] Monitor delegation status on-chain

**Code Example - Secure Implementation:**
```typescript
import { createWeb3Passkey, detectWalletProvider } from 'w3pk'

async function secureDelegation() {
  // 1. Setup w3pk account
  const w3pk = createWeb3Passkey()
  await w3pk.register({ username: 'alice' })
  const w3pkAddress = await w3pk.getAddress()

  // 2. Detect and verify external wallet
  const provider = getDefaultProvider()
  const walletName = detectWalletProvider(provider)

  console.log(`

## Security Changelog

This section tracks major security-related changes to w3pk's implementation.

### v0.7.0+ (Current)

#### Removed: `deriveEncryptionKeyFromSignature()` (Commit 182740c)
**Impact:** Security improvement

**What changed:**
- Removed the `deriveEncryptionKeyFromSignature()` function
- This was a testing/legacy fallback for signature-based key derivation
- Code comment warned: "Does NOT require biometric authentication for decryption"

**Why this improves security:**
- Eliminates a weaker encryption path that could have been misused
- Reduces code complexity and potential for developer errors
- Single clear encryption method (`deriveEncryptionKeyFromWebAuthn()`)
- Prevents accidental use of signature-based approach without proper session management

**Migration:** No action needed. This function was never the primary method and was only used for testing.

#### Current Encryption Method
**Primary:** `deriveEncryptionKeyFromWebAuthn(credentialId, publicKey)`
- Deterministic key derivation from credential metadata
- PBKDF2 with 210,000 iterations (OWASP 2023)
- Fixed salt: `"w3pk-salt-v4"`
- Security relies on SDK authentication-gating

**Status:** Working as intended. This approach enables session management while maintaining security through WebAuthn authentication requirements.

### v0.7.0 - RP ID Auto-Detection (Security Hardening)

**What changed:**
- Removed manual `rpId` configuration option
- RP ID now automatically set to `window.location.hostname`
- Cannot be overridden by developers

**Why this improves security:**
- Prevents misconfiguration that could lead to security vulnerabilities
- Enforces domain isolation (credentials can't be shared across origins)
- Eliminates risk of developers setting overly broad RP IDs
- Simplifies API and reduces surface for errors

**Migration:**
```typescript
// v0.6.0 (old - REMOVED)
const w3pk = createWeb3Passkey({
  rpId: 'example.com',  // Manual configuration (now removed)
})

// v0.7.0+ (current - REQUIRED)
const w3pk = createWeb3Passkey({
  // rpId is auto-detected from window.location.hostname
  // Cannot be overridden
})
```

**Impact:** Breaking change for v0.6.0 users. Credentials created with custom RP IDs may not work. Users must re-register or import mnemonic.

### Backup Encryption Standards

#### Current: PBKDF2 Iterations

**Wallet encryption:** 210,000 iterations (OWASP 2023)
- Primary threat: Online attacks (SDK authentication required)
- PBKDF2 slows down brute force but not primary security boundary
- 210k iterations balance security and performance

**Backup encryption:** 310,000 iterations (OWASP 2025)
- Primary threat: Offline attacks (backups may be on USB/cloud)
- Higher iterations protect against GPU-based brute force
- Performance less critical (one-time backup creation)

**Why different?**
Different threat models require different protections. Backups may be stored offline and face brute force attacks, while wallets are protected by device security and SDK authentication.

**Recommendation:** OWASP updates iteration counts yearly. We plan to update these values as standards evolve, with careful consideration for backward compatibility.

### Password Validation Enhancement

**Added:** `isStrongPassword()` utility
- Minimum 12 characters
- Requires: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Checks against common passwords (password, 123456, qwerty, etc.)
- Score-based validation (≥50/100 required)

**Location:** `src/utils/validation.ts` (exported from main package)

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { isStrongPassword } from 'w3pk'

if (!isStrongPassword(userPassword)) {
  throw new Error('Password too weak')
}
```

**Note:** Password validation is client-side only. Applications should implement server-side validation for production use.

### Known Limitations & Future Improvements

#### Current Limitations

1. **Deterministic Encryption**
   - Current: Key derived deterministically from credential metadata
   - Limitation: Attacker with storage access can decrypt offline
   - Mitigation: SDK authentication-gating + device encryption

2. **Fixed Salt**
   - Current: Uses fixed salt `"w3pk-salt-v4"`
   - Limitation: Not unique per user (though credential ID provides uniqueness)
   - Trade-off: Simplifies implementation, doesn't significantly weaken security

3. **Session Security**
   - Current: Mnemonic cached in JavaScript memory during sessions
   - Limitation: XSS during session can access wallet
   - Mitigation: Short sessions, XSS prevention (CSP)

#### Under Consideration

1. **Web Workers for Session Isolation**
   - Investigate running wallet operations in dedicated Web Worker
   - Would isolate mnemonic from page JavaScript context
   - Challenge: WebAuthn API not available in Workers (requires postMessage)

2. **Per-User Salt Generation**
   - Consider deriving unique salt from credential metadata
   - Would eliminate fixed salt
   - Trade-off: Adds complexity, marginal security benefit

3. **Signature-Based Encryption Option**
   - Consider optional mode that requires fresh signature per operation
   - Would eliminate deterministic key derivation
   - Trade-off: No sessions, biometric prompt every operation
   - Best for ultra-high-security applications

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add built-in rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Track failed attempts, exponential backoff
   - Protection against brute force via authentication

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in w3pk, please report it responsibly:

**Do NOT:**
- Open a public GitHub issue
- Discuss on social media or public forums
- Attempt to exploit in production systems

**Do:**
- Email security details to the maintainers (see README.md)
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Wait for confirmation before public disclosure
- Follow responsible disclosure timeline (typically 90 days)

**We will:**
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Investigate and provide updates
- Work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
- Credit you in security advisories (if desired)

## How It Works

### 1. Encryption Key Derivation

**The encryption key is derived deterministically from WebAuthn credential metadata:**

```typescript
// During registration, a WebAuthn credential is created
const credential = await navigator.credentials.create({
  publicKey: {
    challenge: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)),
    rpId: window.location.hostname,
    userVerification: "required" // Force biometric/PIN
  }
})

// Store credential metadata (public information)
const credentialId = credential.id
const publicKey = credential.response.getPublicKey()

// Derive encryption key from credential metadata (deterministic)
const key = await deriveEncryptionKeyFromWebAuthn(
  credentialId,  // Unique identifier for this credential
  publicKey      // Public key (safe to store)
)

// Encrypt wallet with derived key
const encryptedWallet = await encryptData(mnemonic, key)
```

**How the key derivation works:**

```typescript
// PBKDF2 key derivation
const keyMaterial = credentialId + publicKey  // Concatenate metadata
const salt = "w3pk-salt-v4"                   // Fixed salt (version identifier)
const iterations = 210000                      // OWASP 2023 recommendation

const encryptionKey = await crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
  {
    name: "PBKDF2",
    salt: new TextEncoder().encode(salt),
    iterations: iterations,
    hash: "SHA-256"
  },
  keyMaterial,
  { name: "AES-GCM", length: 256 },
  false,
  ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
)
```

**Important security properties:**

- The encryption key is **deterministic** - the same credential metadata always produces the same key
- An attacker with both localStorage (credential metadata) AND IndexedDB (encrypted wallet) **can derive the encryption key**
- **The actual security boundary is SDK-enforced authentication** - the SDK requires WebAuthn authentication before allowing any operations
- This is **authentication-gated encryption**, not signature-based encryption

**Why this approach is still secure:**

1. **SDK enforces WebAuthn authentication** before any operation:
   ```typescript
   // User must authenticate before the SDK allows decryption
   await w3pk.login()  // ✅ Triggers biometric/PIN prompt
   // Now SDK will decrypt wallet internally
   ```

2. **WebAuthn authentication cannot be bypassed** without:
   - Physical device access AND
   - User's biometric (fingerprint/face) OR device PIN/password
   - Browser shows authentication prompt (user can verify domain)

3. **Even with file access, attacker must authenticate:**
   ```typescript
   // Attacker steals files
   const stolenCredentialId = "..."
   const stolenPublicKey = "..."
   const stolenEncryptedWallet = "..."

   // Can derive the encryption key
   const key = deriveEncryptionKeyFromWebAuthn(stolenCredentialId, stolenPublicKey)

   // Can decrypt the wallet
   const mnemonic = decryptData(stolenEncryptedWallet, key)

   // BUT: To use the wallet via w3pk SDK, must authenticate
   await w3pk.login()  // ❌ BLOCKED: Requires user's biometric/PIN
   ```

4. **Protection from offline attacks:**
   - PBKDF2 with 210,000 iterations slows down brute force
   - But the real protection is that the attacker needs the actual credential metadata (not guessable)
   - Credential IDs are 32+ byte random values (256+ bits of entropy)

**Trade-off: Security vs Usability**

This approach enables **secure sessions**:
- After authentication, the SDK can cache the decrypted mnemonic in memory
- Operations work without repeated biometric prompts for the session duration
- Sessions expire after configured time (default: 1 hour)

An alternative approach (signature-based encryption) would require biometric authentication for every single operation, which is more secure but less usable.

### 2. What's Stored (All Safe to Expose)

#### LocalStorage (Credentials)
```json
{
  "id": "credential-abc123",
  "publicKey": "MFkw...EwYH...AQAB",  // PUBLIC key only
  "username": "alice",
  "ethereumAddress": "0x1234...5678",
  "createdAt": 1234567890
}
```

#### IndexedDB (Encrypted Wallet)
```json
{
  "ethereumAddress": "0x1234...5678",
  "encryptedMnemonic": "v1kT...x3Zp",  // AES-GCM encrypted
  "credentialId": "credential-abc123",
  "createdAt": 1234567890
}
```

**NO secrets stored:**
- No private keys
- No challenge values
- No decryption keys
- Only public identifiers + encrypted data

### 3. Metadata Encryption in LocalStorage (v0.7.4+)

**What changed:**
Starting in v0.7.4, w3pk encrypts sensitive metadata (usernames and Ethereum addresses) in localStorage to prevent XSS attacks from correlating user identities to wallet addresses.

**Previous storage format (before v0.7.4):**
```json
{
  "id": "credential-abc123",
  "publicKey": "MFkw...EwYH...AQAB",
  "username": "alice",                  // ⚠️ PLAINTEXT
  "ethereumAddress": "0x1234...5678",   // ⚠️ PLAINTEXT
  "createdAt": 1234567890
}
```

**New storage format (v0.7.4+):**
```json
{
  "id": "hashed-credential-id",               // SHA-256 hashed
  "encryptedUsername": "v1kT...x3Zp",        // AES-GCM encrypted
  "encryptedAddress": "w2sQ...y4Mp",         // AES-GCM encrypted
  "publicKey": "MFkw...EwYH...AQAB",          // Public key (needed for key derivation)
  "publicKeyFingerprint": "fp1kT...x3Zp",    // SHA-256 hash for verification
  "createdAt": 1234567890,
  "lastUsed": 1234567890
}
```

**Security improvements:**
- ✅ **XSS attacks cannot correlate** usernames to addresses without credential ID
- ✅ **Credential IDs are hashed** - attackers cannot easily enumerate credentials
- ✅ **Public key still stored** - needed for encryption key derivation (public keys are non-sensitive)
- ✅ **Defense in depth** - Even if XSS reads localStorage, sensitive data is encrypted

**Encryption details:**
```typescript
// Metadata key derivation
const keyMaterial = `w3pk-metadata-v1:${credentialId}`
const hash = SHA-256(keyMaterial)

const metadataKey = PBKDF2({
  keyMaterial: hash,
  salt: "w3pk-metadata-salt-v1",
  iterations: 100000,
  hash: "SHA-256",
  keyLength: 256
})

// Encryption
const encryptedUsername = AES-256-GCM(username, metadataKey)
const encryptedAddress = AES-256-GCM(address, metadataKey)
const hashedId = SHA-256(`w3pk-cred-id:${credentialId}`)
const publicKeyFingerprint = SHA-256(publicKey)
```

**Why this matters:**

**Before v0.7.4 - XSS correlation attack:**
```javascript
// Attacker injects malicious script
const credentials = Object.keys(localStorage)
  .filter(k => k.startsWith('w3pk_credential_'))
  .map(k => JSON.parse(localStorage[k]))

// ⚠️ Attacker now knows:
// - All usernames
// - All Ethereum addresses
// - Can correlate: "alice" → "0x1234..."
// - Can track user across different apps
```

**After v0.7.4 - XSS sees only encrypted data:**
```javascript
// Attacker injects malicious script
const credentials = Object.keys(localStorage)
  .filter(k => k.startsWith('w3pk_credential_'))
  .map(k => JSON.parse(localStorage[k]))

// ✅ Attacker only sees:
// - Hashed credential IDs (no user info)
// - Encrypted usernames (need credentialId to decrypt)
// - Encrypted addresses (need credentialId to decrypt)
// - Public key fingerprints (no correlation possible)
// - Cannot correlate users to addresses
```

**Important notes:**
1. **Credential ID still required for lookup** - The credential ID index stores original IDs (not encrypted) to enable O(1) lookups
2. **Search operations are slower** - Finding a credential by username/address requires decrypting all credentials (O(n))
3. **Not backward compatible** - Existing credentials must be re-registered (old plaintext credentials won't work)
4. **Session-based decryption** - Metadata is decrypted on-demand using the credential ID

**Threat model:**

| Attack Scenario | Before v0.7.4 | After v0.7.4 |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| XSS reads localStorage | ❌ Full correlation exposed | ✅ Only encrypted data visible |
| XSS during active session | ❌ Can access wallet | ❌ Can still access wallet |
| File system access only | ⚠️ Username/address visible | ✅ Only encrypted metadata |
| File system + credential ID | ⚠️ Full access | ⚠️ Can decrypt metadata |

**Performance impact:**
- **Save credential:** ~10ms slower (encryption overhead)
- **Get by ID:** ~5ms slower (decryption overhead)
- **Get by username/address:** Much slower - O(1) → O(n) + decryption
- **Get all credentials:** ~N×5ms slower (decrypt each)

**Migration:**
No automatic migration is provided (by design). Users must:
1. Export their mnemonic before upgrading
2. Clear old credentials
3. Re-register with same mnemonic
4. New encrypted storage format will be used

This is a breaking change for security reasons - we don't want to risk accidentally leaving plaintext metadata.

### 4. Storage Architecture

Understanding where w3pk stores data and how browser security mechanisms protect it is critical for threat modeling.

#### Browser Security Mechanisms

**Origin Isolation:**
- localStorage and IndexedDB are **automatically scoped** to origin
- `https://example.com` cannot access `https://attacker.com` storage
- Even subdomains are isolated: `app.example.com` ≠ `example.com`
- Protocol matters: `http://example.com` ≠ `https://example.com`

**WebAuthn Security:**
- Credentials are **cryptographically bound** to RP ID (domain)
- Browser enforces that credentials for `example.com` can only be used on `example.com`
- Even with stolen credential metadata, cannot use on different domain
- User sees domain in authentication prompt

**JavaScript Context:**
- All w3pk code runs in the same JavaScript context as page code
- No process isolation (unlike browser extensions)
- XSS or code injection has full access to w3pk API
- This is why XSS prevention is critical

#### Security Boundaries

**Strong Boundaries (Browser-Enforced):**
1. ✅ **Origin isolation** - Cannot access other domains' storage
2. ✅ **WebAuthn RP ID binding** - Credentials domain-locked
3. ✅ **Secure hardware** - Private keys cannot be exported

**Weak Boundaries (Application-Enforced):**
1. ⚠️ **SDK authentication gating** - Requires honest JavaScript
2. ⚠️ **Session management** - Can be bypassed by code injection
3. ⚠️ **requireAuth flag** - Trivially bypassable

#### Attack Surface by Storage Layer

| Storage Layer | What's Stored | Protection | Attack Surface |
|---------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **localStorage** | Credential metadata (public) | Origin isolation | ⚠️ XSS, file access |
| **IndexedDB** | Encrypted wallet | Origin isolation + AES-256-GCM | ⚠️ XSS, file access + decryption |
| **Memory** | Plaintext mnemonic (during session) | Process isolation (weak) | ❌ XSS, memory dumps |
| **Secure Enclave** | WebAuthn private key | Hardware protection | ✅ Very strong (HW attacks only) |
| **File System** | Browser profile directory | OS permissions | ⚠️ Malware, physical access |

#### Data Flow

**Registration:**
```
1. User clicks "Register"
2. SDK calls navigator.credentials.create()
3. Browser shows WebAuthn prompt → User provides biometric
4. Secure Enclave generates key pair
5. Browser returns: credentialId, publicKey
6. SDK generates mnemonic
7. SDK derives encryption key from credentialId + publicKey
8. SDK encrypts mnemonic with AES-256-GCM
9. SDK stores:
   - localStorage: credentialId, publicKey, address (plaintext)
   - IndexedDB: encryptedMnemonic (ciphertext)
10. Secure Enclave stores: privateKey (hardware-protected)
```

**Login (First Time):**
```
1. User clicks "Login"
2. SDK calls navigator.credentials.get()
3. Browser shows WebAuthn prompt → User provides biometric
4. Secure Enclave signs challenge with privateKey
5. Browser returns: signature
6. SDK verifies signature matches publicKey
7. SDK derives encryption key from credentialId + publicKey
8. SDK decrypts wallet from IndexedDB
9. SDK stores plaintext mnemonic in memory (session)
10. Session expires after configured duration
```

**Login (With Active Session):**
```
1. User clicks "Sign Transaction"
2. SDK checks: hasActiveSession() → true
3. SDK retrieves mnemonic from memory (no prompt)
4. SDK derives private key from mnemonic
5. SDK signs transaction
6. Transaction sent to network
(No biometric prompt - session is active)
```

**Login (Session Expired):**
```
1. User clicks "Sign Transaction"
2. SDK checks: hasActiveSession() → false
3. SDK triggers WebAuthn authentication
4. Browser shows prompt → User provides biometric
5. SDK decrypts wallet, creates new session
6. SDK signs transaction
```

#### File System Locations by Browser

**Chrome/Chromium (macOS):**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/
  ├─ Local Storage/leveldb/
  │   └─ https_example.com_0.localstorage
  └─ IndexedDB/
      └─ https_example.com_0/
```

**Chrome/Chromium (Windows):**
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\
  ├─ Local Storage\leveldb\
  └─ IndexedDB\
```

**Firefox (macOS):**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profile>/
  ├─ webappsstore.sqlite  (localStorage)
  └─ storage/default/https+++example.com/  (IndexedDB)
```

**Safari (macOS):**
```
~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/
~/Library/Safari/Databases/
```

**Security Implications:**
- Browser profile directories are **user-accessible** (not encrypted by browser)
- An attacker with user-level file access can copy these directories
- OS-level encryption (FileVault, BitLocker) is essential
- Malware running as user can access these files
- Cloud backup of browser profiles may expose data

#### Defense in Depth

**Layer 1: Browser Security**
- Origin isolation (strong)
- WebAuthn RP ID binding (strong)
- Process sandboxing (moderate)

**Layer 2: w3pk SDK**
- Authentication gating (moderate - requires honest JS)
- AES-256-GCM encryption (strong - but key is derivable)
- Session management (weak - bypassable)

**Layer 3: Operating System**
- File system permissions (moderate)
- Full disk encryption (strong - FileVault, BitLocker)
- User authentication (moderate - password quality varies)

**Layer 4: Hardware**
- Secure Enclave / TPM (very strong)
- Physical security (depends on user)

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Enable full disk encryption (FileVault on macOS, BitLocker on Windows)
- ✅ Use strong device password (not just PIN)
- ✅ Lock device when away (auto-lock enabled)
- ✅ Keep browser updated (security patches)
- ✅ Use Content Security Policy to prevent XSS
- ✅ Consider dedicated browser profile for financial apps
- ✅ Don't sync browser profile to cloud for high-security use

### 4. Attack Scenario Analysis

#### ⚠️ Attack: Copy files and decrypt offline (Partial Success)

```javascript
// Attacker steals browser storage
const stolen = {
  encryptedMnemonic: "v1kT...x3Zp",
  credentialId: "credential-abc123",
  publicKey: "MFkw...EwYH...AQAB"
}

// Derive the encryption key (deterministic)
const key = deriveEncryptionKeyFromWebAuthn(credentialId, publicKey)
//          ✅ SUCCESS - Key derivation works offline

// Decrypt the wallet
const mnemonic = await decryptData(stolen.encryptedMnemonic, key)
//               ✅ SUCCESS - Wallet is now decrypted
```

**Result:** ⚠️ **Attack partially succeeds** - Attacker can decrypt the wallet offline

**However, to actually USE the wallet via w3pk SDK:**

```javascript
// Attacker tries to use the stolen mnemonic via SDK
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey()
await w3pk.login()
//         ^^^^^^
//         ❌ BLOCKED: Requires WebAuthn authentication
//         Browser shows authentication prompt
//         Attacker cannot provide user's biometric/PIN
```

**Key point:** The encryption protects data at rest, but the real security boundary is **SDK-enforced authentication**. An attacker who steals files can decrypt the mnemonic offline, but:
1. They still need to authenticate to use the SDK
2. Or they could import the mnemonic into another wallet (which is why users should protect their devices)

**Mitigation:** Use device encryption (FileVault, BitLocker) and strong device passwords as an additional layer.

#### ❌ Attack: JavaScript injection to read wallet

```javascript
// Malicious script tries to access wallet via SDK
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey()

// Try to login and access wallet
await w3pk.login()
//         ^^^^^^
//         BLOCKED: Browser shows WebAuthn authentication prompt
//         User sees requesting domain in the prompt
//         If domain is malicious, user should deny
//         User must explicitly provide biometric/PIN

// Even if user authenticates (phished), credentials are domain-scoped
// The attacker's malicious.com credential cannot decrypt
// wallets encrypted with legitimate.com credentials
```

**Result:** ❌ **Attack fails** - WebAuthn is domain-scoped, preventing cross-origin attacks

**However, if attack happens on the SAME domain (XSS):**

```javascript
// XSS attack on legitimate.com
if (w3pk.hasActiveSession()) {
  // If session is active, attacker can access wallet
  const mnemonic = await w3pk.exportMnemonic()
  sendToAttacker(mnemonic)  // ⚠️ SUCCESS during active session
}
```

**Result:** ⚠️ **Attack succeeds if session is active** - This is why:
- Short session durations are critical (`sessionDuration: 0.1` for 6 minutes)
- XSS prevention is essential (CSP, input sanitization)
- The `requireAuth` flag is important but not a security boundary (can be bypassed by XSS)

#### ❌ Attack: Steal credential metadata from another domain

```javascript
// Attacker creates phishing site: examp1e.com (note the "1")
// User has legitimate credential on: example.com

// Attacker steals credential metadata from example.com
const stolenCredentialId = "..."
const stolenPublicKey = "..."
const stolenEncryptedWallet = "..."

// Attacker can derive key and decrypt on their own server
const key = deriveEncryptionKeyFromWebAuthn(stolenCredentialId, stolenPublicKey)
const mnemonic = decryptData(stolenEncryptedWallet, key)

// BUT: To use via WebAuthn, attacker tries to authenticate on examp1e.com
await navigator.credentials.get({
  publicKey: {
    challenge: randomChallenge,
    rpId: "examp1e.com",  // Attacker's domain
    allowCredentials: [{
      id: stolenCredentialId,
      type: "public-key"
    }]
  }
})
//  ❌ BLOCKED: Browser enforces RP ID matching
//  Credential created for "example.com" cannot be used on "examp1e.com"
//  WebAuthn will not find any matching credentials
```

**Result:** ❌ **Attack fails** - WebAuthn credentials are cryptographically bound to the domain (RP ID)

## Encryption Strength

### Wallet Encryption (At Rest)

**Key Derivation:**
- **Algorithm:** PBKDF2-SHA256
- **Iterations:** 210,000 (OWASP 2023 recommendation)
- **Hash:** SHA-256
- **Salt:** Fixed value `"w3pk-salt-v4"` (version identifier)
- **Key Material:** Credential ID (32+ bytes) + Public Key (65-91 bytes)
- **Output:** 256-bit AES key

**Encryption:**
- **Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM
- **Key Size:** 256 bits
- **IV:** Random 12 bytes per encryption
- **Authentication Tag:** 16 bytes (automatic with GCM)
- **Additional Authenticated Data:** Ethereum address (for integrity)

**Entropy Analysis:**
- Credential IDs are cryptographically random (256+ bits of entropy)
- Public keys are derived from private keys (256 bits of entropy)
- Combined key material: ~512 bits of entropy
- PBKDF2 with 210k iterations provides protection against brute force

**Note on Fixed Salt:**
The salt is fixed (`"w3pk-salt-v4"`) rather than random per user. This is acceptable because:
- The credential ID itself provides uniqueness (32+ random bytes)
- Preimage attacks against PBKDF2-SHA256 are not practical
- The primary threat model is online authentication bypass, not offline brute force
- An attacker needs the actual credential metadata (not guessable)

### Backup Encryption (User-Controlled)

**Key Derivation:**
- **Algorithm:** PBKDF2-SHA256
- **Iterations:** 310,000 (OWASP 2025 recommendation) - **stronger than wallet encryption**
- **Hash:** SHA-256
- **Salt:** Random 32 bytes per backup (unique per backup)
- **Key Material:** User-chosen password
- **Output:** 256-bit AES key

**Encryption:**
- **Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM
- **Key Size:** 256 bits
- **IV:** Random 12 bytes per encryption
- **Authentication Tag:** 16 bytes (automatic with GCM)
- **Additional Authenticated Data:** Ethereum address (for integrity)

**Password Requirements:**
Enforced by `isStrongPassword()` utility:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Must include: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Not in common password list (password, 123456, qwerty, etc.)
- Strength score ≥ 50/100

**Why Higher Iterations for Backups:**
Backups are designed for offline storage and face different threat models:
- Wallet encryption: Protected by device security + SDK authentication
- Backup encryption: May be stored on USB drives, cloud, paper - offline brute force is the primary threat
- 310,000 iterations (OWASP 2025) provides additional protection against GPU-based attacks

**Brute Force Resistance:**
Assuming attacker has access to encrypted backup and modern GPU (RTX 4090):
- ~100,000 attempts/second at 310k iterations
- Weak password (40 bits entropy): Hours to days
- Strong password (60 bits entropy): Years to centuries
- Random 16 char password (100 bits entropy): Universe lifetime

## Session Management

### How Sessions Work

w3pk implements **secure in-memory sessions** for better UX. After initial authentication, the decrypted mnemonic is cached in memory for a configurable duration.

```typescript
// Configure session duration (default: 1 hour)
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey({
  sessionDuration: 1 // hours
})

// After login, operations work without repeated authentication
await w3pk.login()              // ✅ Requires biometric
await w3pk.deriveWallet(0)      // ✅ Uses session (no prompt)
await w3pk.exportMnemonic()     // ✅ Uses session (no prompt)
await w3pk.stealth.getKeys()    // ✅ Uses session (no prompt)

// Session expires after 1 hour - next operation will prompt
await w3pk.deriveWallet(1)      // ✅ Prompts for biometric (session expired)
```

### Session Security

w3pk supports **two types of sessions** (v0.8.2+):

1. **In-Memory Sessions** (default): RAM-only, cleared on page refresh
2. **Persistent Sessions** (opt-in): Encrypted in IndexedDB, survives page refresh

**In-Memory Session (default):**
- ✅ Decrypted mnemonic cached in RAM only
- ✅ Session expiration timestamp
- ✅ Credential ID
- ✅ Cleared on page refresh
- ✅ Cleared on logout
- ✅ Cleared when browser tab closes

**Persistent Session (opt-in):**
- ✅ Encrypted mnemonic in IndexedDB
- ✅ Survives page refresh
- ✅ Encrypted with WebAuthn-derived keys
- ✅ Time-limited expiration
- ✅ Only for STANDARD and YOLO modes
- ❌ NEVER persisted for STRICT mode

**What's NOT cached:**
- ❌ Private keys (derived on-demand)
- ❌ WebAuthn signatures (fresh each time)
- ❌ Encryption keys (derived from signatures)

**Security properties:**
- Default sessions exist **only in RAM** - never persisted to disk
- Persistent sessions **encrypted at rest** with WebAuthn-derived keys
- Automatically cleared after expiration
- Cleared on logout (both RAM and persistent)
- Can be manually cleared with `clearSession()`
- STRICT mode **always** requires fresh authentication (no persistence)

### Session Management API

```typescript
// Configure persistent sessions
const w3pk = createWeb3Passkey({
  sessionDuration: 1,        // In-memory session (1 hour)
  persistentSession: {
    enabled: true,           // Enable "Remember Me"
    duration: 168,           // 7 days (in hours)
    requireReauth: true      // Prompt on page refresh
  }
})

// Check if session is active
const hasSession = w3pk.hasActiveSession()

// Get remaining time (in seconds)
const remaining = w3pk.getSessionRemainingTime()

// Extend session by configured duration
w3pk.extendSession()

// Manually clear session (clears both RAM and persistent)
await w3pk.clearSession()

// Update session duration
w3pk.setSessionDuration(2) // 2 hours

// Disable sessions entirely (most secure)
const w3pkNoSessions = createWeb3Passkey({
  sessionDuration: 0,
  persistentSession: { enabled: false }
})

// Use STRICT mode to disable persistent sessions
const strictWallet = await w3pk.deriveWallet('STRICT')
// STRICT mode ALWAYS bypasses persistent sessions
```

### Force Authentication Option

Developers can require fresh authentication for specific operations, even when a session is active:

```typescript
// Force authentication for sensitive operations
await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: true })
await w3pk.signMessage('Transfer $1000', { requireAuth: true })
await w3pk.deriveWallet(5, { requireAuth: true })
await w3pk.stealth.getKeys({ requireAuth: true })

// Example: Context-based security
async function transferFunds(amount: number, recipient: string) {
  // Use STRICT mode for high-value transactions
  const mode = amount > 100 ? 'STRICT' : 'STANDARD'

  const result = await w3pk.signMessage(
    `Transfer ${amount} to ${recipient}`,
    { mode }
  )

  // ... submit transaction with result.signature
}

// Example: Time-based security
async function exportBackup() {
  // Always require fresh auth for backup exports
  const mnemonic = await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: true })

  // ... show mnemonic to user
}
```

**Use cases for `requireAuth: true`:**
- High-value transactions (amount-based)
- Exporting recovery phrases
- Changing critical settings
- Administrative operations
- Time-sensitive operations after long idle

### ⚠️ Important: `requireAuth` is NOT a Security Boundary

**Can `requireAuth` be bypassed?**
**Yes** - An attacker with JavaScript execution in your app can bypass this flag:

```javascript
// Attacker bypasses requireAuth
await w3pk.signMessage('Steal funds', { requireAuth: false })
```

**What `requireAuth` actually protects:**
- ✅ Honest users making mistakes (accidental clicks)
- ✅ Application-level policy enforcement
- ✅ User experience (confirmation for sensitive actions)
- ✅ Compliance requirements (audit trails)

**What `requireAuth` does NOT protect:**
- ❌ Code injection attacks (XSS)
- ❌ Malicious browser extensions
- ❌ Compromised dependencies
- ❌ Active attackers with JS execution

**The REAL security boundaries are:**

1. **WebAuthn Browser Prompt** (Strongest)
   - Cannot be bypassed without physical biometric/PIN
   - Browser-enforced, origin-bound
   - User sees requesting domain

2. **Session Expiration** (Strong)
   - Limits attack window to session duration
   - Attacker must act within time limit
   - Shorter sessions = smaller attack surface

3. **Signature-Based Encryption** (Strong)
   - Protects wallet at rest
   - File system access useless without authentication
   - Cannot decrypt without fresh signature

4. **`requireAuth` Flag** (Weak - UX/Policy Only)
   - Can be bypassed by code injection
   - Not a security boundary
   - Think: seatbelt, not bulletproof vest

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

```typescript
// Scenario: Malicious browser extension active session
// Attacker can steal mnemonic during session window
setInterval(async () => {
  if (w3pk.hasActiveSession()) {
    const mnemonic = await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: false })
    sendToAttacker(mnemonic) // ❌ Stolen!
  }
}, 1000)

// Mitigation: Very short sessions
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey({ sessionDuration: 0.1 }) // 6 minutes

// Scenario: XSS attack + expired session
await w3pk.exportMnemonic({ requireAuth: false })
// ✅ Session expired - user sees authentication prompt
// ⚠️  User might authenticate thinking it's legitimate

// Mitigation: User education + short sessions
```

**Recommendations for High Security:**

```typescript
// 1. Minimal session duration
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey({ sessionDuration: 0.1 }) // 6 min

// 2. Or disable sessions entirely
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey({ sessionDuration: 0 })

// 3. Combine with defense in depth:
// - Content Security Policy (prevent XSS)
// - Subresource Integrity (prevent CDN attacks)
// - Dependency auditing (prevent supply chain)
// - User education (recognize suspicious prompts)
```

### Session Threat Model

#### ✅ Session protected against:
1. **Disk access** - Session never written to storage
2. **Browser restart** - Session cleared automatically
3. **Tab close** - Memory freed immediately
4. **Automatic expiration** - Sessions timeout after configured duration

#### ⚠️ Session vulnerable to:
1. **Active browser exploitation** - If attacker has code execution in the same tab
2. **Memory dumps** - If attacker can dump browser process memory (requires elevated privileges)
3. **Physical access** - If device unlocked and session active

**Recommendation:** For maximum security, set `sessionDuration: 0` to require authentication for every operation. For better UX, use the default 1 hour session.

## Integration Best Practices

Since `requireAuth` and sessions can be bypassed by code execution, here are **essential security measures** to prevent attacks:

### 1. Build Verification

Verify the integrity of the w3pk package before using it in production:

```typescript
import { getCurrentBuildHash, verifyBuildHash } from 'w3pk'

// On application startup
const TRUSTED_HASH = 'bafybeiafdhdxz3c3nhxtrhe7zpxfco5dlywpvzzscl277hojn7zosmrob4' // From GitHub releases

async function verifyW3pkIntegrity() {
  try {
    const currentHash = await getCurrentBuildHash()
    const isValid = await verifyBuildHash(TRUSTED_HASH)

    if (!isValid) {
      console.error('⚠️  W3PK build verification failed!')
      console.error('Expected:', TRUSTED_HASH)
      console.error('Got:', currentHash)

      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
        throw new Error('W3PK package integrity check failed')
      }
    } else {
      console.log('✅ W3PK build verified')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Build verification error:', error)
  }
}

await verifyW3pkIntegrity()
```

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Store trusted hashes in your backend or secure configuration
- ✅ Verify on application startup
- ✅ Fail securely in production if verification fails
- ✅ Compare hashes from multiple sources (npm, CDN, GitHub releases)
- ✅ Use HTTPS when fetching build files
- ✅ Monitor for unexpected hash changes

**Where to get trusted hashes:**
1. GitHub releases (check signed release notes)
2. Official documentation
3. Multiple CDN sources for comparison
4. Build locally and compare: `pnpm build && pnpm build:hash`

See [Build Verification Guide](./BUILD_VERIFICATION.md) for detailed documentation.

### 2. Prevent XSS Attacks

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Add strict CSP headers to prevent script injection:

```html
<!-- In your HTML -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self';
               script-src 'self' 'nonce-{RANDOM}';
               style-src 'self' 'nonce-{RANDOM}';
               object-src 'none';
               base-uri 'self';
               form-action 'self';">
```

Or via HTTP headers:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-{RANDOM}'; object-src 'none'
```

**Best practices:**
- ❌ Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`
- ✅ Use nonces for inline scripts
- ✅ Whitelist only trusted domains
- ✅ Use `strict-dynamic` for modern browsers

#### Input Sanitization

```typescript
// Sanitize all user inputs
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify'

function displayUsername(username: string) {
  // ❌ NEVER do this:
  element.innerHTML = username

  // ✅ DO this:
  element.textContent = username

  // ✅ OR if HTML needed:
  element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(username)
}
```

#### Output Encoding

```typescript
// Encode data before display
function showTransaction(recipient: string) {
  // ✅ Use proper encoding
  const encoded = encodeURIComponent(recipient)

  // ✅ Or use framework escaping (React, Vue, etc.)
  return <div>{recipient}</div> // React auto-escapes
}
```

#### Framework-Specific Protection

**React:**
```typescript
// ✅ React auto-escapes by default
<div>{userInput}</div>

// ❌ Dangerous - only use for trusted content
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}} />
```

**Vue:**
```vue
<!-- ✅ Vue auto-escapes -->
<div>{{ userInput }}</div>

<!-- ❌ Dangerous -->
<div v-html="userInput"></div>
```

### 3. Defend Against Malicious Browser Extensions

#### Extension Isolation Strategies

```typescript
// 1. Detect suspicious extension behavior
function detectExtensionInjection() {
  const originalFetch = window.fetch
  let fetchModified = false

  setTimeout(() => {
    if (window.fetch !== originalFetch) {
      console.warn('Fetch API modified - possible extension interference')
      fetchModified = true
    }
  }, 100)

  return fetchModified
}

// 2. Protect sensitive operations with iframe isolation
function createIsolatedContext() {
  const iframe = document.createElement('iframe')
  iframe.sandbox = 'allow-same-origin allow-scripts'
  iframe.style.display = 'none'
  document.body.appendChild(iframe)

  // Use iframe's clean window context
  return iframe.contentWindow
}

// 3. Short sessions limit exposure
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey({
  sessionDuration: 0.1 // 6 minutes - limits extension attack window
})
```

#### User Education

Display warnings when detecting extensions:

```typescript
// Check for common wallet extension conflicts
const hasMetaMask = typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined'
const hasExtensions = detectExtensionInjection()

if (hasExtensions) {
  showWarning(
    'Browser extensions detected. ' +
    'For maximum security, use a dedicated browser profile ' +
    'without extensions when accessing your wallet.'
  )
}
```

#### Browser Profile Recommendation

```typescript
// In your UI/documentation
const securityMessage = `
🔒 Security Recommendation:
- Create a dedicated browser profile for wallet operations
- Disable all browser extensions in this profile
- Use this profile only for financial transactions
`
```

### 4. Prevent Compromised Dependencies (Supply Chain)

#### Package Auditing

```bash
# Regular security audits
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Use audit in CI/CD
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Alternative: use pnpm or yarn for better security
pnpm audit
```

#### Lock File Integrity

```bash
# Always commit lock files
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Lock dependencies"

# Verify lock file in CI
npm ci  # Fails if package.json and lock mismatch
```

#### Subresource Integrity (SRI)

For CDN-loaded scripts:

```html
<!-- ✅ Use SRI hashes -->
<script
  src="https://cdn.example.com/w3pk.js"
  integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC"
  crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

Generate SRI hashes:
```bash
# Generate hash
curl https://cdn.example.com/w3pk.js | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A
```

#### Dependency Monitoring

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npm audit",
    "security-check": "npx snyk test"
  }
}
```

Use security services:
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
- [Socket](https://socket.dev/)
- [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) (GitHub)

#### Minimal Dependencies

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid kitchen-sink libraries
import _ from 'lodash' // 70KB

// ✅ Import only what you need
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce' // 2KB
```

Review dependencies regularly:
```bash
# List dependency tree
npm list
pnpm list --depth=1

# Check package size
npx bundlephobia lodash
```

### 5. Prevent Code Injection

#### Secure Build Pipeline

```typescript
// In your build config (vite.config.ts, webpack.config.js)
export default {
  build: {
    // Minify and obfuscate
    minify: 'terser',
    terserOptions: {
      compress: {
        drop_console: true, // Remove console logs in production
      }
    },

    // Enable source maps only in development
    sourcemap: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',

    // Rollup security options
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['crypto', 'buffer'], // Don't bundle Node.js modules
    }
  }
}
```

#### Runtime Integrity Checks

```typescript
// Detect if code has been tampered with
class IntegrityChecker {
  private checksum: string

  constructor() {
    // Store checksum of critical code at build time
    this.checksum = this.calculateChecksum()
  }

  private calculateChecksum(): string {
    // Calculate hash of critical functions
    const criticalCode = [
      w3pk.signMessage.toString(),
      w3pk.exportMnemonic.toString(),
    ].join('')

    return this.hash(criticalCode)
  }

  verify(): boolean {
    const currentChecksum = this.calculateChecksum()
    return currentChecksum === this.checksum
  }

  private hash(str: string): string {
    // Simple hash (use crypto.subtle.digest in production)
    let hash = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
      hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + str.charCodeAt(i)
      hash = hash & hash
    }
    return hash.toString(36)
  }
}

// Use in critical operations
const checker = new IntegrityChecker()
if (!checker.verify()) {
  throw new Error('Code integrity check failed - possible tampering')
}
```

#### Freeze Critical Objects

```typescript
// Prevent prototype pollution and tampering
Object.freeze(Object.prototype)
Object.freeze(Array.prototype)
Object.freeze(String.prototype)

// Freeze critical SDK methods
Object.freeze(w3pk.signMessage)
Object.freeze(w3pk.exportMnemonic)
Object.freeze(w3pk.deriveWallet)
```

#### Secure Coding Patterns

```typescript
// ❌ Don't use eval or Function constructor
eval(userInput) // NEVER
new Function(userInput)() // NEVER

// ❌ Don't use innerHTML with user content
element.innerHTML = userInput // DANGEROUS

// ✅ Use safe alternatives
element.textContent = userInput
element.setAttribute('data-value', userInput)

// ❌ Don't trust client-side validation only
if (amount > 0) { // Can be bypassed
  transfer(amount)
}

// ✅ Always validate on both sides
async function transfer(amount: number) {
  // Server-side validation
  const response = await fetch('/api/validate', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ amount })
  })

  if (response.ok) {
    // Proceed with transfer
  }
}
```

### 5. Defense in Depth Strategy

Combine multiple layers:

```typescript
const w3pk = new Web3Passkey({
  // 1. Short sessions (limit attack window)
  sessionDuration: 0.1, // 6 minutes

  // 2. Callbacks for security events
  onError: (error) => {
    // Log security events
    reportSecurityEvent({
      type: 'error',
      message: error.message,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    })
  }
})

// 3. Rate limiting sensitive operations
const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({ maxAttempts: 3, windowMs: 60000 })

async function secureSignMessage(message: string) {
  // Check integrity
  if (!integrityChecker.verify()) {
    throw new Error('Code tampering detected')
  }

  // Rate limit
  if (!rateLimiter.attempt()) {
    throw new Error('Too many attempts')
  }

  // Detect extensions
  if (detectExtensionInjection()) {
    console.warn('Extension interference detected')
  }

  // Always require auth for high-value
  const requireAuth = parseAmount(message) > 100

  return w3pk.signMessage(message, { requireAuth })
}
```

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting

```typescript
// Monitor suspicious behavior
class SecurityMonitor {
  private attemptCounts = new Map<string, number>()

  trackOperation(operation: string) {
    const count = (this.attemptCounts.get(operation) || 0) + 1
    this.attemptCounts.set(operation, count)

    // Alert on suspicious patterns
    if (count > 10) {
      this.alert(`Suspicious: ${operation} called ${count} times`)
    }
  }

  private alert(message: string) {
    // Log to monitoring service
    console.error('[SECURITY]', message)

    // Optional: Send to backend
    fetch('/api/security-alert', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ message, timestamp: Date.now() })
    })
  }
}

const monitor = new SecurityMonitor()
monitor.trackOperation('exportMnemonic')
```

## Credential Scoping and Domain Isolation

### Credentials are Domain-Specific

**Important:** Credentials created on one web application **cannot be used on another web application**, even for the same username. This is a fundamental WebAuthn security feature.

### How It Works

When you register a credential, it is cryptographically bound to the domain:

```typescript
// Registration on example.com
const registrationOptions = {
  challenge,
  rp: {
    name: "w3pk",
    id: window.location.hostname,  // "example.com"
  },
  user: {
    id: username,
    name: username,
    displayName: username,
  },
  // ...
}

// Authentication on example.com
const authOptions = {
  challenge,
  rpId: window.location.hostname,  // Must be "example.com"
  userVerification: "required",
  // ...
}
```

**Key Points:**

1. **RP ID is auto-detected**: The Relying Party ID (RP ID) is automatically set to `window.location.hostname`
2. **Cannot be configured**: Manual RP ID configuration was removed in v0.7.0 to enforce security
3. **Cryptographically bound**: The WebAuthn credential private key is tied to the RP ID
4. **Browser-enforced**: The browser's WebAuthn API enforces this isolation

### Why Credentials Don't Work Across Domains

**Example scenario:**

```typescript
// Step 1: Register on app1.com
// User visits: https://app1.com
await w3pk.register({ username: 'alice' })
// → RP ID: "app1.com"
// → Credential created and bound to "app1.com"
// → Stored in browser with origin: "https://app1.com"

// Step 2: Try to login on app2.com
// User visits: https://app2.com
await w3pk.login()
// → RP ID: "app2.com" (different!)
// → Browser WebAuthn API: "No credential found for RP ID 'app2.com'"
// → Login fails ❌

// Step 3: Must register separately on app2.com
await w3pk.register({ username: 'alice' })
// → Creates NEW credential for "app2.com"
// → This is a completely separate credential
```

### Security Guarantees

This domain isolation provides critical security guarantees:

#### ✅ Protection Against Phishing

```typescript
// Legitimate site: example.com
await w3pk.register({ username: 'alice' })
// RP ID: "example.com"

// Phishing site: examp1e.com (note the "1")
await w3pk.login()
// RP ID: "examp1e.com" (different!)
// ❌ Credential not found - phishing attempt blocked
```

The attacker **cannot** use your `example.com` credential even if they:
- Copy your localStorage data
- Copy your IndexedDB data
- Trick you into visiting their site
- Use an identical UI

The browser enforces that credentials for `example.com` can only be used on `example.com`.

#### ✅ Origin-Based Storage Isolation

```typescript
// Browser storage is automatically scoped by origin
localStorage  // Scoped to "https://example.com"
IndexedDB     // Scoped to "https://example.com"

// A different origin cannot access this storage
// - https://attacker.com → different origin
// - https://subdomain.example.com → different origin (unless RP ID configured for parent)
// - http://example.com → different origin (different protocol)
```

#### ✅ No Cross-Site Credential Replay

```typescript
// Even if attacker intercepts network traffic
const stolenSignature = interceptFromNetwork()

// They cannot replay it on their site
await navigator.credentials.get({
  publicKey: {
    challenge: stolenChallenge,
    rpId: "attacker.com",  // Different RP ID!
    // ...
  }
})
// ❌ Browser rejects: "RP ID mismatch"
```

### Subdomain Considerations

**By default, credentials are scoped to the exact hostname:**

```typescript
// Registered on: app.example.com
// RP ID: "app.example.com"

// Cannot use on: api.example.com (different subdomain)
// Cannot use on: example.com (parent domain)
```

**Note:** The WebAuthn standard allows setting RP ID to a parent domain, but w3pk uses auto-detection which sets it to the exact hostname for maximum security.

### Localhost and Development

During development, credentials are scoped to `localhost`:

```typescript
// Development environment
window.location.hostname  // "localhost"
// RP ID: "localhost"

// Credentials created during development:
// ✅ Work on: http://localhost:3000
// ✅ Work on: http://localhost:8080
// ✅ Work on: https://localhost:5173
// ❌ Don't work on: 127.0.0.1 (different hostname!)
```

**Development tip:** Always use `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1`, for consistent RP ID.

### Migration from v0.6.0 to v0.7.0

In v0.6.0, the RP ID could be manually configured:

```typescript
// v0.6.0 (old)
const w3pk = createWeb3Passkey({
  rpId: 'example.com',  // Manual configuration
})
```

In v0.7.0+, this was removed for security:

```typescript
// v0.7.0+ (current)
const w3pk = createWeb3Passkey({
  // rpId is auto-detected from window.location.hostname
  // Cannot be overridden
})
```

**Why this change?**
- Prevents misconfiguration
- Enforces best practices
- Eliminates cross-origin credential risks
- Simplifies API

### Credential Storage and Scoping

**What's stored and where:**

```typescript
// localStorage (origin-scoped by browser)
// Key: w3pk_credential_<credentialId>
{
  "id": "credential-abc123",
  "publicKey": "MFkw...",      // Public key only
  "username": "alice",
  "ethereumAddress": "0x1234...",
  "createdAt": 1234567890
}

// IndexedDB (origin-scoped by browser)
// Store: wallets
{
  "ethereumAddress": "0x1234...",
  "encryptedMnemonic": "v1kT...",  // AES-GCM encrypted
  "credentialId": "credential-abc123",
  "createdAt": 1234567890
}

// Authenticator (hardware/platform)
// WebAuthn private key (bound to RP ID)
// - Cannot be exported
// - Cannot be used for different RP ID
// - Hardware-protected
```

**Security properties:**

1. **localStorage**: Origin-scoped by browser (cannot access from different origin)
2. **IndexedDB**: Origin-scoped by browser + encrypted with WebAuthn signature
3. **Authenticator**: RP ID-bound + hardware-protected

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use the same wallet on multiple domains?**

A: No, each domain requires separate registration. However, you can import the same mnemonic on different domains to access the same wallet addresses:

```typescript
// On domain1.com
const { mnemonic } = await w3pk.register({ username: 'alice' })
// Save mnemonic: "word1 word2 ... word12"

// On domain2.com (later)
await w3pk.register({
  username: 'alice',
  mnemonic: 'word1 word2 ... word12'  // Import same mnemonic
})
// ✅ Same wallet addresses, different WebAuthn credential
```

**Q: What if I want to share credentials across subdomains?**

A: Currently not supported. Each subdomain requires separate registration. This is the most secure approach.

**Q: Can I migrate credentials between domains?**

A: WebAuthn credentials cannot be migrated, but wallets can:

1. Export mnemonic from old domain
2. Register on new domain with same mnemonic
3. Same wallet addresses, new credential

**Q: What happens if I switch from `app.example.com` to `example.com`?**

A: These are different RP IDs. You'll need to re-register. Export your mnemonic first to preserve your wallet.

### Security Best Practices

1. **Educate users**: Make it clear that credentials are per-domain
2. **Prompt for backup**: Always prompt users to save their mnemonic after registration
3. **Test on production domain**: Don't expect development credentials to work in production
4. **Use consistent domains**: Avoid switching between `www.example.com` and `example.com`
5. **Display current domain**: Show users which domain they're authenticating for

### Implementation Example

```typescript
// Show user which domain they're registering on
const currentDomain = window.location.hostname

console.log(`🔐 Creating credential for: ${currentDomain}`)
console.log(`⚠️  This credential will only work on ${currentDomain}`)

await w3pk.register({ username: 'alice' })

console.log(`✅ Credential created for ${currentDomain}`)
console.log(`💾 Save your recovery phrase - you'll need it to access`)
console.log(`   this wallet on other domains or devices`)
```

## WebAuthn Security Features

### User Verification
w3pk enforces `userVerification: "required"`, which means:

- **Platform authenticators** (TouchID, FaceID, Windows Hello):
  - Biometric verification required
  - Local-only (biometric never leaves device)
  - Hardware-protected

- **Security keys** (YubiKey, etc.):
  - PIN required
  - FIDO2 certified hardware
  - Tamper-resistant

### Credential Protection
- **Resident credentials** (discoverable):
  - Stored in authenticator hardware
  - Protected by Secure Enclave/TPM
  - Cannot be extracted

- **Private key** never exposed:
  - Signature operations happen in hardware
  - Key never enters browser/OS memory
  - Cannot be dumped or stolen

## Authenticator's Built-In Credential Storage

### What Is It?

Modern authenticators (TouchID, Windows Hello, YubiKey) have **built-in secure storage** for credentials. This is separate from browser storage and provides additional security.

### How It Works

```

```

### Security Benefits

1. **Hardware Protection**
   - Private keys stored in Secure Enclave (iOS) or TPM (Windows)
   - Cannot be extracted even with root/admin access
   - Survives malware/OS compromise

2. **Biometric Storage**
   - Fingerprints/face data NEVER leave device
   - Stored in encrypted hardware
   - Matched locally in secure element

3. **Credential Backup** (Platform-dependent)
   - **iCloud Keychain** (iOS/macOS):
     - Credentials sync across user's Apple devices
     - End-to-end encrypted
     - Requires device unlock

   - **Windows Hello**:
     - Tied to specific device/TPM
     - Does NOT sync by default
     - Requires device PIN

   - **Android**:
     - Can backup to Google account
     - End-to-end encrypted
     - Requires screen unlock

### Considerations for w3pk

**The authenticator stores:**
- ✅ WebAuthn private key (secure)
- ✅ Credential metadata (credential ID, RP ID)
- ❌ **NOT** the wallet mnemonic

**The wallet mnemonic is stored:**
- In browser IndexedDB (encrypted)
- Can only be decrypted with WebAuthn signature
- Requires fresh biometric authentication

**This means:**
- Losing your authenticator = Lose access to decrypt wallet
- **CRITICAL:** Users must save their mnemonic phrase
- Mnemonic is the ultimate recovery mechanism
- WebAuthn is for convenience + security, not recovery

## Backup & Recovery Security

w3pk implements a **three-layer backup and recovery system** that balances security, usability, and resilience. Each layer uses different cryptographic primitives and trust models.

### Layer 1: Passkey Auto-Sync (Platform-Based)

**How it works:**
- WebAuthn credentials automatically sync via platform services (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, Microsoft Account)
- Encrypted end-to-end by platform provider
- Requires device unlock + cloud account authentication

**Security properties:**
- ✅ **Encrypted in transit** - Platform handles E2E encryption
- ✅ **Hardware-backed** - Credentials protected by Secure Enclave/TPM
- ✅ **Automatic** - No user action required
- ⚠️ **Platform trust** - Relies on Apple/Google/Microsoft security
- ⚠️ **Ecosystem lock-in** - Cannot cross platforms (Apple → Android)

**Threat model:**
| Threat | Protected? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Device loss (same ecosystem) | ✅ Yes | Credentials restore on new device |
| Device loss (cross-platform) | ❌ No | Need Layer 2 (mnemonic) |
| Platform account compromise | ⚠️ Depends | Platform MFA protects |
| State-level attack on cloud | ⚠️ Possible | Platform E2E encryption helps |

### Layer 2: Encrypted Backups (User-Controlled)

**How it works:**
- Mnemonic encrypted with user-chosen password
- Multiple backup formats: QR codes and backup files
- Encryption: **AES-256-GCM** with **PBKDF2** (310,000 iterations, OWASP 2025 standard)

**Security properties:**
- ✅ **Military-grade encryption** - AES-256-GCM
- ✅ **Password-based** - User controls secret
- ✅ **Offline storage** - Can be stored on paper/USB/safe
- ✅ **Platform-independent** - Works across any device
- ⚠️ **Password strength critical** - Weak password = vulnerable

**Cryptographic details:**
```typescript
// Key derivation
PBKDF2-SHA256
├─ Iterations: 310,000 (OWASP 2025)
├─ Salt: 32 bytes (random per backup)
└─ Output: 256-bit key

// Encryption
AES-256-GCM
├─ Key: From PBKDF2
├─ IV: 12 bytes (random per encryption)
├─ Auth tag: 16 bytes (automatic)
└─ Additional data: Ethereum address (for integrity)
```

**Password validation:**
w3pk enforces strong passwords:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + special chars
- Not in common password list
- Strength score ≥50/100 required

**Using `isStrongPassword` utility:**
```typescript
import { isStrongPassword } from 'w3pk'

// Validate before creating backups
const password = userInput
if (!isStrongPassword(password)) {
  throw new Error('Password must be at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters')
}

// Now safe to create backup
const blob = await w3pk.createZipBackup(password)
```

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Test fixtures - not real passwords!
isStrongPassword('Test1234!@#$')        // ✅ true
isStrongPassword('Example1@Correct')    // ✅ true
isStrongPassword('weak')                // ❌ false - too short
isStrongPassword('NoNumbersHere!')      // ❌ false - missing numbers
isStrongPassword('Password123!Foo')     // ❌ false - contains "password"
```

**Threat model:**
| Threat | Protected? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Backup file stolen | ✅ Yes | Requires password to decrypt |
| Weak password | ⚠️ Vulnerable | User responsibility |
| Password forgotten | ❌ Unrecoverable | Need Layer 3 (social recovery) |
| Brute force (strong password) | ✅ Yes | 310k iterations slow down attacks |
| Brute force (weak password) | ❌ Vulnerable | Minutes to hours with GPU |

**Brute force analysis:**

Assuming attacker has:
- Modern GPU (RTX 4090)
- ~100,000 PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes/second at 310k iterations

| Password Type | Entropy | Time to Crack |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| `password123` (common) | ~20 bits | Seconds |
| `MyPassword123!` (weak) | ~35 bits | Hours |
| `MyS3cur3!Pass@2024` (medium) | ~50 bits | Months |
| `correct horse battery staple` (strong) | ~80 bits | Centuries |
| Truly random 16 chars | ~100 bits | Universe lifetime |

**Recommendation:** Use password manager to generate strong passwords or use multi-word passphrases (4+ random words).

### Layer 3: Social Recovery (Distributed Trust)

**How it works:**
- Mnemonic split into **N shares** using **Shamir Secret Sharing**
- Requires **M-of-N** shares to recover (e.g., 3-of-5)
- Each guardian receives encrypted share via QR code
- Guardians never see the actual mnemonic

**Cryptographic details:**
```typescript
// Shamir Secret Sharing over GF(256)
├─ Threshold: M (minimum shares needed)
├─ Total shares: N (total guardians)
├─ Secret: Mnemonic (67 bytes UTF-8)
├─ Polynomial degree: M-1
├─ Field: Galois Field GF(256)
│   ├─ Primitive polynomial: x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 (0x11b)
│   ├─ Generator: 3
│   └─ Lagrange interpolation for reconstruction
└─ Share format:
    ├─ Byte 0: X coordinate (1-255)
    └─ Bytes 1-67: Y values (polynomial evaluation)

// Guardian share encryption
AES-256-GCM (same as Layer 2)
├─ Optional: Guardian can password-protect their share
└─ QR code includes guardian metadata + instructions
```

**Security properties:**
- ✅ **Information-theoretic security** - Cannot learn secret from M-1 shares
- ✅ **Distributed trust** - No single point of failure
- ✅ **Privacy-preserving** - Guardians never see mnemonic
- ✅ **Flexible threshold** - Customize M-of-N based on risk tolerance
- ⚠️ **Coordination required** - Must contact M guardians
- ⚠️ **Guardian trust** - Guardians could collude (if ≥M)

**Threat model:**
| Threat | Protected? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| M-1 guardians compromised | ✅ Yes | Cannot recover without Mth share |
| M guardians collude | ❌ Vulnerable | Can reconstruct mnemonic |
| All guardians lost | ❌ Unrecoverable | Need Layer 2 backup |
| Guardian share stolen | ✅ Depends | If password-protected, still safe |
| User forgets who guardians are | ⚠️ Problem | Keep guardian list separately |

**Information-theoretic security proof:**

Shamir Secret Sharing over GF(256) provides perfect secrecy:
- Given M-1 shares, **every possible secret is equally likely**
- Attacker learns **zero bits** of information about secret
- No amount of computation can break this (unlike encryption)

Mathematical proof:
```
For threshold M and secret S:
- Polynomial P(x) = a₀ + a₁x + ... + aₘ₋₁x^(M-1)
- Secret: S = P(0) = a₀
- Share i: Sᵢ = P(i)

Given M-1 shares {S₁, S₂, ..., Sₘ₋₁}:
- Infinite polynomials pass through these points
- Each yields different P(0) = a₀
- All secrets equally probable
- H(S | S₁,...,Sₘ₋₁) = H(S)  [Shannon entropy unchanged]
```

**Example configuration:**

| Scenario | Threshold | Guardians | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| High paranoia | 5-of-7 | 7 close friends | Can lose 2 guardians |
| Balanced | 3-of-5 | 5 trusted contacts | Standard recommendation |
| Convenience | 2-of-3 | 3 family members | Easy to coordinate |
| Multi-sig like | 2-of-2 | 2 co-owners | Both must agree |

**Security scoring:**

w3pk calculates a security score (0-100) based on active backup methods:

| Configuration | Score | Level |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| No backups | 0-25 | 🔴 Vulnerable |
| Passkey sync only | 30-50 | 🟡 Protected |
| Passkey + encrypted backup | 60-80 | 🟢 Secured |
| All three layers | 85-100 | 🟦 Fort Knox |

**Score calculation:**
```typescript
score = 0
+ (passkeySync.enabled ? 30 : 0)
+ (backups.file > 0 ? 25 : 0)
+ (backups.qr > 0 ? 15 : 0)
+ (socialRecovery.configured ? 30 : 0)
```

### Backup Best Practices

**1. Use multiple layers:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Enable all three layers
await w3pk.setupSocialRecovery([...guardians], 3)
await w3pk.createZipBackup('MyS3cur3!Password@2024')
// Passkey sync enabled by default on platform

// ❌ BAD: Rely on single layer
// (only passkey sync - what if switch platforms?)
```

**2. Test recovery before trusting:**
```typescript
// Simulate recovery scenarios
const test1 = await w3pk.simulateRecoveryScenario({
  type: 'lost-device',
  hasBackup: true,
  hasSocialRecovery: true
})
console.log('Can recover?', test1.canRecover)

const test2 = await w3pk.simulateRecoveryScenario({
  type: 'lost-phrase',
  hasPasskeySync: true
})
console.log('Can recover?', test2.canRecover)
```

**3. Store backups securely:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Offline, encrypted, geographically distributed
- Physical safe (home)
- Safety deposit box (bank)
- Encrypted USB drive (office)
- Password manager (different password)

// ❌ BAD: Digital-only, centralized
- Cloud storage unencrypted
- Email to self
- Single location
- Shared with others
```

**4. Choose guardians wisely:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD guardian criteria:
- Trustworthy (won't collude)
- Available (can reach when needed)
- Technical (understands basic security)
- Diverse (different locations/relationships)
- Long-term (stable relationship)

// ❌ BAD guardian choices:
- All family members (could collude)
- All same location (disaster risk)
- Strangers/acquaintances
- People who might lose share
```

**5. Use strong passwords:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD passwords:
'correct horse battery staple'  // Multi-word passphrase
'MyS3cur3!Backup@December2024'  // Long with variety
(password manager generated)     // Truly random

// ❌ BAD passwords:
'password123'      // Common
'MyPassword'       // Dictionary word
'12345678'         // Sequential
'qwerty123'        // Keyboard pattern
```

### API Security Considerations

**All backup operations require authentication:**
```typescript
// These operations trigger biometric prompt
await w3pk.createZipBackup(password)        // ✅ Auth required
await w3pk.createQRBackup(password)         // ✅ Auth required
await w3pk.setupSocialRecovery(...)         // ✅ Auth required
await w3pk.exportMnemonic()                 // ✅ Auth required

// Read-only operations don't require auth
await w3pk.getBackupStatus()                // ✅ No auth needed
await w3pk.getSyncStatus()                  // ✅ No auth needed
```

**Password validation is client-side:**
⚠️ **Important:** Password strength is checked in the browser. A determined attacker with code execution could bypass validation and create backups with weak passwords.

**Mitigation:**
- Use `requireAuth: true` for backup creation
- Short session durations
- XSS/injection protection (CSP, input sanitization)
- Educate users on password strength

**Recovery operations don't require authentication:**
```typescript
// Recovery from existing backups is public
await w3pk.restoreFromBackup(encryptedData, password)
await w3pk.recoverFromGuardians([shares...])

// Rationale: If user has backup data + password/shares,
// they own the wallet regardless of authentication
```

### Comparison with Other Recovery Systems

| Recovery Method | w3pk Layer 1 | w3pk Layer 2 | w3pk Layer 3 | Traditional Seed | Hardware Wallet |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Automatic** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual |
| **Cross-platform** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Offline storage** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | N/A |
| **No single point** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Cryptographic** | ✅ E2E | ✅ AES-256 | ✅ Shamir | N/A | N/A |
| **User effort** | None | Medium | High | Low | None |
| **Trust model** | Platform | Self | Distributed | Self | Self |

## Best Practices for Users

### 1. **Always Save Your Mnemonic**
```typescript
const { mnemonic } = await w3pk.register({ username: 'alice' })

// ⚠️ CRITICAL: Save this offline
console.log('Write this down:', mnemonic)
```

**Why?**
- If you lose/reset your device, mnemonic is only recovery
- WebAuthn credentials are device-specific
- Hardware failure = need mnemonic

### 2. **Understand Your Authenticator**

| Authenticator | Backup? | Sync? | Recovery |
|--------------|---------|-------|----------|
| TouchID/FaceID (iCloud enabled) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Other Apple devices |
| TouchID/FaceID (iCloud disabled) | ❌ No | ❌ No | Mnemonic only |
| Windows Hello | ❌ No | ❌ No | Mnemonic only |
| Android (Google backup) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Other Android devices |
| YubiKey | ❌ No | ❌ No | Mnemonic only |

### 3. **Device Loss Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Lost iPhone (iCloud Keychain enabled)**
- ✅ Get new iPhone
- ✅ Sign into iCloud
- ✅ WebAuthn credentials restore automatically
- ✅ Can decrypt wallet (no mnemonic needed)

**Scenario 2: Lost iPhone (iCloud Keychain disabled)**
- ❌ WebAuthn credentials lost
- ✅ Import mnemonic on new device
- ✅ Re-register with new WebAuthn credential
- ✅ Wallet recovered

**Scenario 3: Wiped Computer**
- ❌ All browser data lost
- ❌ WebAuthn credentials lost (except external security keys)
- ✅ Import mnemonic
- ✅ Re-register
- ✅ Wallet recovered

## Threat Model Summary

| Threat | Protected? | How |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Malware steals browser files | ✅ Yes | Files are encrypted, key requires biometric |
| Keylogger captures password | ✅ Yes | No password - uses biometric |
| Phishing site | ⚠️ Partial | WebAuthn checks domain, but user must verify |
| Physical device theft | ✅ Yes | Biometric/PIN required |
| Database dump | ✅ Yes | Wallet encrypted with signature-derived key |
| Active session hijacking | ❌ No | If wallet in memory, can be accessed |
| Device loss without backup | ⚠️ Depends | Need mnemonic if authenticator not backed up |
| Coercion (forced authentication) | ❌ No | Cannot prevent forced biometric |

## Security Recommendations

### For Developers

1. **Never store secrets** in localStorage/sessionStorage
2. **Always require re-authentication** for sensitive operations
3. **Use `userVerification: "required"`** to enforce biometric/PIN
4. **Prompt users to save mnemonic** prominently during registration
5. **Clear wallet from memory** after operations complete

### For Users

1. **Write down your mnemonic** on paper (offline)
2. **Enable authenticator backup** if available (iCloud Keychain, etc.)
3. **Test recovery** before storing significant funds
4. **Use strong device security** (PIN/password)
5. **Verify domain** before authenticating
6. **Keep devices updated** for security patches

## Comparison: w3pk vs Traditional Wallets

| Feature | w3pk | MetaMask | Hardware Wallet |
|---------|------|----------|-----------------|
| Password required | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (PIN on device) |
| Biometric auth | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Seed phrase backup | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ✅ Required |
| File access = theft? | ⚠️ **Partial*** | ⚠️ **Partial*** | ❌ No |
| Keylogger risk | ❌ **No** | ✅ **Yes** | ❌ No |
| XSS risk (active session) | ⚠️ **Yes** | ⚠️ **Yes** | ⚠️ Limited (per-tx) |
| Remote attack protection | ✅ Strong | ⚠️ Password-dependent | ✅ Strong |
| Offline brute force | ⚠️ Possible† | ⚠️ Possible† | ❌ Not possible |
| Hardware required | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Cost | Free | Free | $50-200 |
| Best for | Convenience + Security | General use | High-value holdings |

**\*File access = theft?**
- **w3pk:** Can decrypt mnemonic with localStorage + IndexedDB. Requires device encryption for full protection.
- **MetaMask:** Can decrypt vault with password. Weak passwords are vulnerable to brute force.
- **Hardware Wallet:** Private keys never leave device. File access doesn't help attacker.

**†Offline brute force:**
- **w3pk:** Attacker needs actual credential metadata (32+ byte random ID). Not guessable, but if stolen with encrypted wallet, can decrypt offline.
- **MetaMask:** Attacker needs password. Weak passwords can be brute-forced. Strong passwords with vault encryption are resistant.
- **Hardware Wallet:** Private keys in secure element. Cannot be extracted even with physical access (except advanced hardware attacks).

## Security Inspection Tools

w3pk includes built-in security inspection capabilities to help developers and end-users analyze web3 applications and understand their transaction and signing methods.

### Why Inspection Matters

Many users interact with web3 applications without fully understanding:
- What transactions the app can initiate
- Which signing methods are used
- How their private keys or wallets are being accessed
- What permissions they're granting

The w3pk inspection tools provide **transparency** by analyzing application code and generating detailed security reports.

### Browser-Based Inspection

End-users can inspect any web3 application directly from their browser console:

```typescript
import { inspectNow } from 'w3pk'

// Run inspection and view report in console
await inspectNow()
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches all JavaScript files from the current page
- Extracts transaction and signing-related code snippets
- Sends code to Rukh API for AI-powered analysis
- Generates a security report listing all methods

**Use cases:**
- End-users auditing dApps before connecting wallets
- Security researchers analyzing application behavior
- Developers verifying their own implementations

### Node.js-Based Inspection

Developers can scan local application files during development or in CI/CD:

```typescript
import { inspect } from 'w3pk/inspect/node'

const report = await inspect(
  '../my-dapp',
  'https://rukh.w3hc.org',
  'w3pk',
  'anthropic',
  'transactions'
)
```

**What it does:**
- Recursively scans application source files
- Filters for transaction-relevant code
- Generates comprehensive markdown documentation
- Sends to Rukh API for security analysis

**Use cases:**
- Pre-deployment security audits
- CI/CD security checks
- Documentation generation
- Code review assistance

### Focus Modes

Both browser and Node.js inspection support focus modes:

**`transactions` mode (default):**
- Only analyzes transaction and signing code
- Filters for keywords: `signMessage`, `sendTransaction`, `Contract`, `authorization`, etc.
- Faster analysis, more focused reports
- Recommended for security audits

**`all` mode:**
- Analyzes all application code
- Comprehensive but slower
- May include irrelevant code in report
- Use for complete application analysis

### Privacy and Security

**Data handling:**
- Code is sent to Rukh API for analysis
- Rukh uses AI models (Anthropic Claude, Mistral, OpenAI)
- No code is stored permanently by default
- Reports are generated on-demand

**Recommendations:**
- Use self-hosted Rukh instance for sensitive code
- Review reports before sharing externally
- Inspection tools are read-only (no modifications)
- Browser inspection requires CORS-enabled scripts

### Integration with Development Workflow

```bash
# Add to package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "security:inspect": "tsx scripts/inspect.ts"
  }
}
```

```typescript
// scripts/inspect.ts
import { inspect } from 'w3pk/inspect/node'
import fs from 'fs/promises'

const report = await inspect(
  process.cwd(),
  'https://rukh.w3hc.org',
  'w3pk',
  'anthropic',
  'transactions'
)

await fs.writeFile('SECURITY_REPORT.md', report)
console.log('✅ Security report generated')
```

### Empowering End-Users

The browser inspection tools are designed for non-technical users:

```javascript
// Users can run this in any browser console
await w3pk.inspectNow()
```

This democratizes security analysis and helps users make informed decisions about which dApps to trust.

## Conclusion

w3pk's security model combines **WebAuthn authentication** with **deterministic encryption** to provide strong protection against remote attacks and convenient biometric access. Understanding both the strengths and limitations is critical for secure deployment.

**Key Security Properties:**

1. **Strong Protection Against Remote Attacks**
   - WebAuthn authentication required for SDK operations
   - Domain-scoped credentials prevent phishing
   - No keylogger risk (biometric, not password)
   - Better than password-based wallets for online threats

2. **Encryption At Rest (with caveats)**
   - Wallet encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   - Key derived from credential metadata (deterministic)
   - **Important:** An attacker with file system access CAN decrypt offline
   - Real protection comes from SDK authentication-gating, not cryptographic impossibility

3. **Defense in Depth Required**
   - Use device encryption (FileVault, BitLocker, etc.)
   - Use strong device passwords
   - Keep sessions short or disabled for sensitive apps
   - Implement XSS prevention (CSP, input sanitization)
   - Don't rely solely on w3pk encryption for protection

**What You Need to Know:**

An attacker would need different things depending on their goal:

**To decrypt the wallet offline (outside w3pk):**
- Access to browser storage files (localStorage + IndexedDB)
- Can then import mnemonic into any wallet

**To use the wallet via w3pk SDK:**
- Physical access to your device, AND
- Your fingerprint/face/PIN to authenticate, OR
- Code execution during active session (XSS)

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Save your mnemonic securely (ultimate recovery)
- ✅ Use device encryption + strong device password
- ✅ Short sessions for sensitive applications (`sessionDuration: 0.1` or `0`)
- ✅ Implement XSS prevention (this is critical)
- ✅ Understand that w3pk provides convenience + authentication gating, not cryptographic impossibility
- ✅ Use hardware wallets for very high-value holdings (>$10k)

w3pk provides a strong balance between **security and usability** for most web3 applications. It's significantly more secure than password-based wallets against online threats, while providing biometric convenience. However, it should be deployed with proper device security and XSS prevention for maximum protection.
