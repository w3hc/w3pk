## 📚 Three Recovery Layers Explained

### **Layer 1: Passkey Auto-Sync** (Easiest)

**What it is:**
- Your WebAuthn credential (fingerprint/Face ID) automatically syncs across your devices
- Platform-dependent (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, etc.)

**How it works:**
```
Device 1 (iPhone)          iCloud Keychain          Device 2 (Mac)
     |                            |                         |
     |-- Passkey Created -------->|                         |
     |                            |                         |
     |                            |<----- Login on Mac -----|
     |                            |                         |
     |                     Passkey Synced                   |
     |                            |------- Decrypt -------->|
     |                            |        Wallet           |
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic (no user action needed)
- ✅ Instant recovery on new device
- ✅ Hardware-protected security
- ✅ Works immediately after setup

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Platform-specific (Apple/Google/Microsoft)
- ⚠️ Requires cloud account
- ⚠️ May not work across different ecosystems

**Recovery scenarios:**
| Scenario | Can Recover? | How |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Lost iPhone (iCloud enabled) | ✅ Yes | Sign in on new iPhone → Passkey auto-syncs |
| Lost iPhone (iCloud disabled) | ❌ No | Need Layer 2 (mnemonic) |
| New Mac (same iCloud) | ✅ Yes | Passkey available immediately |
| Switch to Android | ❌ No | Need Layer 2 (mnemonic) |

---

### **Layer 2: Encrypted Backup** (Universal)

**What it is:**
- Your 12-word recovery phrase encrypted and packaged for safe storage
- Multiple backup formats: password-protected ZIP, QR code, encrypted file

**How it works:**
```typescript
1. User creates backup with password
2. System generates encrypted package:
   ├─ Mnemonic encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   ├─ Password-derived key (PBKDF2, 310,000 iterations)
   └─ Device fingerprint binding (optional)
3. User saves encrypted file/QR code
4. To recover: Provide password → Decrypt → Import mnemonic
```

**Backup Methods:**

#### A. **Password-Protected ZIP File** (Recommended)
```typescript
await backupManager.createEncryptedZipBackup('my-strong-password')
// Downloads: wallet-backup-2025-10-26.zip
// Contains:
//   - recovery-phrase.txt.enc (encrypted mnemonic)
//   - metadata.json (wallet address, creation date)
//   - instructions.txt (how to restore)
```

**Security:**
- Multi-layer encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- PBKDF2 key derivation (310,000 iterations)
- Optional device fingerprint binding
- Verification checksum included

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works on any device/platform
- ✅ Password protection
- ✅ Can store in cloud (encrypted)
- ✅ Universal wallet compatibility (BIP39)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ User must remember password
- ⚠️ Can be lost if not stored properly
- ⚠️ Manual backup creation required

#### B. **QR Code Backup** (Offline/Paranoid Mode)
```typescript
await backupManager.createQRCodeBackup('optional-password')
// Generates QR code containing encrypted mnemonic
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ 100% offline
- ✅ Can print and store physically
- ✅ No cloud dependency
- ✅ Scannable from any device

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Can be lost/destroyed
- ⚠️ QR code damage = data loss
- ⚠️ Physical security concerns

#### C. **Encrypted File Backup**
```typescript
await backupManager.createEncryptedFile(password, 'my-backup.enc')
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple file storage
- ✅ Can copy to USB drive
- ✅ Email to yourself (encrypted)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires password
- ⚠️ File can be lost

**Recovery scenarios:**
| Scenario | Can Recover? | How |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Lost all devices | ✅ Yes | Import backup file + password |
| Forgot password | ❌ No | Cannot decrypt backup |
| Backup file lost | ❌ No | Need Layer 3 (social recovery) |
| Switch wallet apps | ✅ Yes | BIP39 works everywhere |

---

### **Layer 3: Social Recovery** (Ultimate Safety Net)

**What it is:**
- Your recovery phrase split into encrypted shares
- Distributed to trusted friends/family (guardians)
- Requires M-of-N shares to recover (e.g., 3 out of 5)

**How it works (Shamir Secret Sharing):**
```typescript
// Setup: Split mnemonic into 5 shares, require 3 to recover
const guardians = [
  { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
  { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' },
  { name: 'Charlie', email: 'charlie@example.com' },
  { name: 'Diana', email: 'diana@example.com' },
  { name: 'Eve', email: 'eve@example.com' }
]

await socialRecovery.setup(mnemonic, guardians, threshold: 3)

// Generates 5 encrypted shares:
// Share 1 → Alice (via QR code or encrypted email)
// Share 2 → Bob
// Share 3 → Charlie
// Share 4 → Diana
// Share 5 → Eve

// To recover: Collect any 3 shares
const shares = [aliceShare, bobShare, charlieShare]
const recoveredMnemonic = await socialRecovery.recover(shares)
```

**Mathematical Security:**
- Uses Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm
- Any 3 shares = full recovery
- Any 2 shares = mathematically impossible to recover
- Each guardian only has an encrypted piece

**Guardian Responsibilities:**
```
🛡️ You are Guardian 2/5

Your friend has entrusted you with a recovery share.

What this means:
- You hold 1 piece of a 3-piece puzzle
- 3 guardians needed to recover wallet
- Keep this safe but accessible

How to help recover:
1. Friend will request your share
2. Scan your QR code or enter share code
3. System verifies and reconstructs wallet

⚠️ Never share unless friend requests it!
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No single point of failure
- ✅ Survives your own forgetfulness
- ✅ Survives any 2 guardians disappearing
- ✅ Highest security and redundancy

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires trusted friends/family
- ⚠️ Setup complexity
- ⚠️ Recovery takes time (24-48 hours)
- ⚠️ Coordination required

**Recovery scenarios:**
| Scenario | Can Recover? | How |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Forgot password + lost devices | ✅ Yes | Contact 3 guardians → combine shares |
| Lost backup + lost passkey | ✅ Yes | Contact 3 guardians |
| 2 guardians unavailable | ✅ Yes | Still have 3 others |
| All guardians lost shares | ❌ No | Need another recovery layer |

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### **Encrypted ZIP Backup Details**

When you create a password-protected ZIP backup, here's what happens:

```typescript
Input:
- mnemonic: "test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
- password: "my-super-secure-password-123"

Process:
1. Derive encryption key from password
   ├─ Salt: Random 32 bytes
   ├─ Algorithm: PBKDF2-SHA256
   ├─ Iterations: 310,000 (OWASP 2025 recommendation)
   └─ Output: 256-bit AES key

2. Encrypt mnemonic
   ├─ Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
   ├─ IV: Random 12 bytes
   ├─ Input: mnemonic plaintext
   └─ Output: encrypted ciphertext + auth tag

3. Optional: Add device fingerprint binding
   ├─ Hash: SHA-256(browser + OS + device ID)
   ├─ Purpose: Prevent copy/paste to different device
   └─ Bypass: Can be disabled for portability

4. Create ZIP package
   ├─ recovery-phrase.txt.enc (encrypted mnemonic)
   ├─ metadata.json (address, creation date, checksum)
   ├─ salt.bin (for PBKDF2)
   ├─ instructions.txt (recovery guide)
   └─ verification.json (address checksum for verification)

Output:
- wallet-backup-2025-10-26.zip (password-protected)
```

**Security guarantees:**
- ✅ **Cannot decrypt without password** (brute-force resistant with 310k iterations)
- ✅ **Verification checksum** ensures correct recovery
- ✅ **Metadata separate** from encrypted data
- ✅ **Safe to store in cloud** (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

**Recovery verification:**
```typescript
After decryption:
1. Derive Ethereum address from recovered mnemonic
2. Compare with metadata.json checksum
3. Match = ✅ Success
4. No match = ❌ Wrong password or corrupted file
```

---

### **QR Code Backup Details**

```typescript
QR Code contains:
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "encrypted", // or "plain" (not recommended)
  "data": "encrypted_mnemonic_base64",
  "salt": "salt_base64",
  "checksum": "address_checksum",
  "iterations": 310000
}

Properties:
- Error correction: Level H (30% damage tolerance)
- Can be printed and stored physically
- Scannable from any device with camera
- Optional password protection
```

**Use cases:**
- 📄 Print and store in safe deposit box
- 🏦 Give to trusted family member (physical)
- 💾 Offline cold storage
- 🔒 Air-gapped backup

---

### **Social Recovery Cryptography**

```typescript
Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm:

Example: 3-of-5 scheme
- Split secret S into 5 shares: s1, s2, s3, s4, s5
- Any 3 shares can reconstruct S
- Any 2 shares reveal ZERO information about S

Mathematical basis:
- Polynomial interpolation over finite field
- Degree = threshold - 1 (e.g., degree-2 polynomial for 3-of-5)
- Points on polynomial = shares
- Reconstruct polynomial with 3 points → get secret

Share encryption:
Each share is encrypted with guardian's public key:
- Guardian generates key pair (on their device)
- Share encrypted with guardian's public key
- Only guardian can decrypt their share
- Prevents share theft from coordinator
```

**Trust model:**
```
Coordinator (You):
- Cannot recover from less than threshold shares
- Can revoke/replace guardians
- Can update threshold

Guardians:
- Cannot recover alone
- Cannot collude unless threshold met
- Can verify share validity
- Can export/backup their share

Attacker:
- Cannot recover with < threshold shares
- Cannot brute-force (mathematically secure)
- Must compromise guardians directly
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **Password Requirements**

For encrypted backups, enforce strong passwords:

```typescript
import { isStrongPassword } from 'w3pk'

// Validate password before creating backup
const password = userInput
if (!isStrongPassword(password)) {
  // Show error to user
  throw new Error('Password does not meet security requirements')
}

// Password is strong - proceed with backup
const blob = await w3pk.createZipBackup(password)
```

**Password requirements:**
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character
- Not a common password (dictionary check)

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Test fixtures - not real passwords!
isStrongPassword('Test1234!@#$')     // ✅ Valid
isStrongPassword('weak')             // ❌ Too short
isStrongPassword('Password123!Foo')  // ❌ Contains "password"
```

**Strength indicator:**
- 0-25%   : ❌ Weak (rejected)
- 26-50%  : ⚠️  Fair (warning shown)
- 51-75%  : 🟡 Good (accepted)
- 76-100% : ✅ Strong (recommended)

### **Backup Storage Best Practices**

Educate users on where to store backups:

```typescript
Recommended storage:
✅ Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden)
✅ Encrypted cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive) - file is already encrypted
✅ USB drive in safe
✅ Physical printout in safe deposit box

NOT recommended:
❌ Email (unencrypted transmission)
❌ Plain text file on desktop
❌ Cloud storage without password protection
❌ Shared drives
```

### **Guardian Selection Guidelines**

```typescript
Good guardians:
✅ Trusted family/friends
✅ Tech-savvy (can handle QR codes)
✅ Geographically distributed
✅ Long-term relationships
✅ Available when needed

Bad guardians:
❌ Strangers or acquaintances
❌ Same physical location (house fire risk)
❌ Not tech-savvy (cannot help)
❌ Transient relationships
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use multiple backup methods?**
A: Yes! We recommend using at least 2 methods for redundancy.

**Q: Is my encrypted backup safe to store in Google Drive?**
A: Yes, the backup is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and cannot be decrypted without your password.

**Q: What if I forget my backup password?**
A: You'll need to use another recovery method (passkey sync or social recovery). Password cannot be reset.

**Q: How secure is social recovery?**
A: Mathematically secure with Shamir's Secret Sharing. Any 2 guardians cannot recover (need 3 of 5).

**Q: Can guardians steal my wallet?**
A: No, each guardian only has an encrypted piece. They need 3 pieces minimum, and even then, shares are encrypted.

**Q: What happens if a guardian loses their share?**
A: No problem! You only need 3 out of 5. As long as 3 guardians have their shares, you can recover.

**Q: Can I change guardians later?**
A: Yes, you can add/remove/replace guardians anytime. You'll need to redistribute new shares.

**Q: Does passkey sync work across Apple and Android?**
A: No, passkey sync is ecosystem-specific. Use encrypted backup or social recovery for cross-platform.

**Q: How often should I update my backup?**
A: Your mnemonic never changes! One backup is enough. Only update if you change your mnemonic.

**Q: Is this better than writing down 12 words on paper?**
A: Paper backup is good! Our system adds encryption and multiple options for convenience and security.
