## [0.7.3] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed

- **Critical:** Fixed base64url decoding errors during registration that caused `Failed to execute 'atob' on 'Window': The string to be decoded is not correctly encoded` error
- Fixed backup encryption/decryption failures due to incorrect binary data encoding
- Fixed WebAuthn attestation object decoding with proper padding handling
- Fixed authentication signature verification with improved base64url support

### Added

- New `src/utils/base64.ts` module with robust base64/base64url utilities:
  - `base64UrlToArrayBuffer()` - Safely decodes base64url with automatic padding
  - `arrayBufferToBase64Url()` - Encodes to URL-safe base64url format
  - `safeAtob()` - Handles both base64 and base64url with proper padding
  - `safeBtoa()` - Handles Unicode text encoding safely

### Changed

- Updated all authentication modules to use new base64 utilities
- Updated crypto module to use consistent base64url encoding
- Improved error messages for base64 decoding failures

### Technical Details

The root cause was that WebAuthn responses use base64url encoding (URL-safe), which:
1. Removes `=` padding characters
2. Uses `-` and `_` instead of `+` and `/`

The native `atob()` function requires standard base64 with proper padding, causing decoding failures. The new utilities automatically handle padding and character conversion, making the SDK more robust when dealing with WebAuthn and other base64url-encoded data.

### Migration

No breaking changes. All existing code continues to work. The fixes are internal improvements to encoding/decoding routines.
